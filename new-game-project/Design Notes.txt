Additive:
	the "Load Scene"'s additive function puts two scenes in the same ActiveScene stage


Rollback:
	Don't implement rollback the way does it. No scrollwheel, and no "Back" button.
	Tie rollback to the backlog where it's possible to load a save with the exact
	state game was in at the backlog message, ala loading save.
	Pihqura tells you to do this during the poll sections if youre not confident in your results.
	
Saving:
	The plan is most likely to have saves tied to the character slots, which there are three of.
	"Read messages" is most likely tied to your character. If you save backwards you can skip the mesasges.
	There are two autosaves - the first saves every line. The second saves at automatic points.
		Autosave, and Pointsave.
	Maybe have three pointsave slots, which overwrite the oldest when they activate.
	The one in slot one is ALWAYS the newest one.
	
	What if there's a gamestate resource that json turns into when you load it and the resource is what
	lets you revert to previous saves in backlog
		
Chapter Select:
	The game lets you choose the start of specific chapters from your file.
	It's like ace attorney where you have to opt in to the episode to select it.
	The only exception is the prologue. (The cutoffpoint is right before Kenne duel)
	After you complete an episode, load will be completely blank.
	The chapter select screen may have a specific UI...?
	The player just doesnt have access to chapter select without beating prologue btw
	CHapter select always starts locked, but unlocks as soon as you start the chapter.
	Sections unlock as you reach their initial points
	
Title Screen
	Maybe skip title screen?
	Or have a quick version of it if there's already a file on it
	Something like STS title flow where it just kind of assumes the slot youre at is the one youre playing
	
Skip Messages:
	Skip is in the game but only works with messages youve seen as character. Rollback allowing message skipping should work.
