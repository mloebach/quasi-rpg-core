[b]Episode 4[/b]: Into the Sunken Fortune

• We start this episode with a brief glimse of the formation of Winckary and Trophistus’s alliance that took place last episode
◦ Winckary agrees to the alliance for much of the same reason she agreed to with the other players
◦ The two agree to keep the alliance a secret from the other players

• Flashback scene is in cave
◦ We see Liburri’s cave elder
◦ We see Liburri take care of some children and older folk in her cave
◦ We learn about Breizan cave-blindness, where the people of Liburri’s cave commonly go blind.
◦ We learn about Liburri, her parents died when she was young and she’s one of the strongest people in her village.
◦ The elders debate if Liburri should be allowed to go on the journey, out of concerns that the poisons of the outside world may permanently warp her mind.
◦ The people of the village let Liburri go on the journey because they believe she could be Zenith re-incarnated, the chosen hero {zenith_name}.
• The Group arrive in Fortune Harvest very early into episode
◦ Fortune Harvest is a giant casino which runs on Somni energy that is active at night.

◦ There are various attractions, which include a Battle Arena, Card Game Parlor, Rapquawk Racing, Slot Machines, the Auction House, etc. This is the area where all the fun RPG mini-games are at.
◦ It’s near a lake, and is a popular destination for tourists visiting the Skychosen Lands. The wealthiest of the Skychosen Lands congregate here.

——————

• Deyacron thanks Liburri for her role in last challenge
◦ If you hadn’t alerted me to the horde of monsters, I would have been toast!
◦ Liburri responds…neutrally. It wasn’t enough for them to win the challenge, she’s just saying that…
• In talks of strategy, yhere is an increased focus on item-based healing because of how the outcome of the last match was decided by Ehrugarr having an item.
• JQ3 at a Gelato Shop
• Ehrugarr and Trophistus scene
◦ They’re in a bakery, and he’s getting lunch.
• Ehrugarr doesn’t like Gelato very much
• Ehrugarr takes a look at the hilt of Trophistus’s sword from the scabbard. It looks…different.
• Ehrugarr confessional
◦ He respects the fight Regamirr put up, and registers that she was a strong opponent
◦ However, he feels no different. Everything still feels the same, from before he beat Regamirr to after
• Veveya barges in She bought some ice cream for Ehrugarr and herself
◦ She sees Trophistus
• Scene ends with a confessional where Veveya admits she doesn’t really get good vibes from the attention Ehrugarr is getting Trophistus
◦ She concedes this might be jealousy but it could be suspicion

• We see a Somni Vapor shop in Fortune Harvest
◦ The joint is called “Taste of Heaven”
◦ People who buy and sell Somni so they can enter dreams
◦ Negative effects on bodies
◦ People can quickly become addicted to it
◦ (Somni energy is o en used for regulated therapeutic purposes, but this is not one of those places)
◦ “I don’t look down on the practice, but those who know Somni work can use Somni Therapeutic extort people who are hooked down to their final Mynt”
◦ We see one of the customers who keeps on returning to see dreams of his wife that le him and the kids she took with her.
◦ “This is…unfortunately, one of the big reasons the Skychosen Lands is popular among tourists - Somni Therapy.”
◦ “It’s best to look away. You can become addicted if you can’t tell dreams from reality.

Uelgwold and JQ3 talk strategy
◦ Now that Qujeon’s team has crumbled, who are the biggest threats in the Pilgrimage?
◦ Uelgwold asks, and JQ3 has very little hesitation for her answers - Trophistus, Ehrugarr, and Winckary. The three of them are difficult to trust, but if they’re all in on it together, that would be bad for everyone. All three need to go eventually, but the question is…what order?
◦ Trophistus is the one in control, as exposed by last episode. Should they stop the problem by fighting through his pawns until none remain, or yank the batteries out of this machine right away?

———————
• Throwaway confessional from Havi
◦ They don’t like how obviously proactive Trophistus is
◦ He feels like he’s intentionally moving the game in a fast way
◦ “What a pain. I would prefer to sleep in.”
◦ They also highlight how much Qujeon was a moron - did they really think all four people he forced into his crew were okay with that strategy if only one of them could win?
• Havi reflects on their own role in the game
◦ They feel like a pawn in everyone’s schemes, and someone who is ultimately expendable
◦ Once Ozapold’s dream team of him, themselves, JQ3, Veveya, and possible Trophistus enter the end, they’ll most likely be determined the weakest link. Havi easily seems themselves, even if things go perfectly, dropping once the Gauntlet arrives.
• Havi reflects on the people le in the game, those with some claim to win.
◦ They don’t like Ozapold
▪ “He’s a stubborn old fool who only has a few good years le .”
◦ They really don’t like Uelgwold.
▪ “He’s a shameless pervert who only thinks with his dick. The Star Salted Sea would be no better with a wild animal.”
◦ They really really don’t like Deyacron
▪ “She’s a delusional justice-blinded meat-head. Like hell I trust someone that full of themselves with any leadership position. And they really REALLY don’t like Trophistus
▪ “Do I even have to say anything after last challenge?”
▪ “I thought it would be funny to work with him, but he’s only out for himself. I wasted my time.”
▪ “He very obviously wants to control the Platoon, and he could easily be getting there with how much he’s getting into Ozapold’s pockets.”
▪ “Gross.”

◦ “Wow, there aren’t a lot of good options le . Really, I don’t think I want any of these people to win.”
◦ Havi then decides to turn their thinking around. Who here, if they won, would fuck up the world the most. Who winning would be the most upsetting and hilarious for everyone else here?
◦ Havi realizes what they have to do

———————
• Yunyere is eating lunch. On his plate is buttered bread and sausages with a glass of milk on the side.
• Havi walks up to Yunyere and asks if they want to form an alliance
◦ “Mind if we train together, for the good of Graddia (…or whatever).”
◦ Yunyere accepts
• Cut to Havi Confessional.
◦ “Huh.”
◦ “That actually worked?”
• We’re still in the Havi confessional.
◦ “…huh?”
◦ “You’re asking why? Why him.”
◦ “….”
◦ “Because it would be funny. That’s why.”
———————

• Kennewick gloats about a new skill they learned while they were away
◦ “It’s a…trap spell! It shall give me perfect defense!”
Two dragon heads are created in the air out of dark matter. Their mouthes are open, revealing a dark energy inside.
◦ [provide visual]
Kennewick makes a joke. The dragon heads are bombs! They have no weakness! There’s no way to stop the explosion when they are up! Not even… by firing magic into the dragon’s mouths! So don’t even think about it!
◦ Deyacron instinctively fires an ice shard into jaws of one of the dragons.
◦ That dragon portal head’s snaps shut…and the ice shot is shot out of the other. 
◦ Deyacron quickly dodges her own attack. The heads disappear. 
• Kennewick explains
◦ “You FOOL! You fell for my TRICK! They were NEVER bombs!”
◦ “If you fire any magic spell into one of the dragons, it gets shot out the other with twice as much power!”
◦ “I call them the Dragon Deflectors! With them, I shall never be hit by a magical spell again! It’s a completely impenetrable defense! A perfect spell! If I use this in a duel I’ll be invincible!”
◦ “Don’t think I forgot about offense, either! If you put your arm into them, it burns your hand! REALLY BADLY!”
• Reception is mixed
◦ “….”
◦ “How is that going to protect you from…anything but a single projectile?”
◦ “I don’t know. I appreciate the attempt. I’ll take Deyacron’s ice shield any day.”
———————

• Ehrugarr and Veveya scene
◦ Ehrugarr mentions the emotional significance of Heat Sharpened Claw and that he’s the terminarch

———————

• Deyacron travels a bit further and sees a temple…underwater
◦ She hears from the locals that the temple is cursed by the underworld
• This is where the bell tower is at, surrounded by water.
• Liburri comes into the scene
◦ Deyacron learns that Liburri has primarily gotten her food from foraging
◦ She’s also been eating eggs, but she doesn’t really like eggs
◦ Deyacron decides to show Liburri around
———————

Deyacron shows Liburri around the town
◦ Deyacron buys Liburri a peach from a market
◦ The seller tries to sell it by going over how the Skychosen Lands’ peaches are unique and sweeter
◦ Liburri bites into it
▪ The experience is unlike anything before it
▪ Liburri thinks of them like magic
◦ Liburri quickly finishes it off, she can’t help herself
◦ Liburri asks what monster you’d have to slay for them in order to obtain peaches
▪ “Monster? Well, I wouldn’t exactly call my peach orchard a monster.”
▪ Liburri: ….”
▪ “This is a fruit which comes from a tree. A peach has a seed in it, and if you take care of that seed, it’ll grow into a tree which will sprout dven more peaches!”
◦ Deyacron buys a few more for her
———————

• Havi tries to lay the foundation for their new alliance with Yunyere 
• Havi probes Yunyere about what his life is like as a royal knight.
• The conversation eventually reaches the topic of the queen Yunyere is set to marry.
◦ “There’s a lot to like about her! She has long hair, likes to wear gorgeous blue dresses, and is the heir to the throne!”
• Havi notably has a lot of very concerned looking sprite expressions this whole conversation while Yunyere explains what he thinks of the future Graddian queen


• ….
• Havi confides more of their motives, and its obvious they're thinking of things on the spot. What can they say to butter Yunyere up? Hm…
▪ Well, Yunyere is, very obviously,  {zenith_name}. Havi has studied him, and has the evidence to back it up, but just needs to prove it to everyone else.
▪ This is incredibly important.
▪ Because of someone OTHER than Yunyere wins?
▪ Their soul will be judged as black-hearted by the Spring. It is a tool only meant for {zenith_name}. And if they drink from it, they will be corrupted into another Dark Husk.
▪ That….could spell the end of this world and all world.
▪ So, Yunyere’s victory is imperative.
▪ Yunyere takes it and enthusiastically aligns himself with Havi.
▪ Havi admits in a confessional that they didn’t know where they were going with that at the start, and the story kinda came to them. They only believe about 15% of it. It seems to have wrapped itself up nicely…
——————

• Auction House scene
• An auction occurs.
• Everyone is wearing masks.
• The items are described. Among them are…
◦ The Escape Orb
▪ When you press down on it, it acts as a smoke screen. It can be used to escape battles with 100% guarantee.
▪ While Smoke Screens are sold and also allow escape with 100% accuracy, those are somewhat rare / expensive consumable items while the ball is usable infinitely.
▪ It is sold as useful in a pinch. The warning is given to be careful with the Smoke Ball that if you run away from all your battles you could no longer have enough EXP to be competitive. 
▪ The Smoke Ball’s base price is notably high.
◦ The Cherub Egg!
▪ This is a held item which increases Experience Yield when held by 1.2x.
• Havi wins the Escape Orb
◦ Trophistus bids on it after Havi, but after Havi bids on it again, they drop it
◦ They end up spending a pretty fair chunk of their money on it
◦ The smoke ball can now allow Havi to escape from any battle they want
• Trophistus wins the Cherub Egg in exhange
———————
• Ehrugarr wants to learn the truth behind Trophistus’s powers to gain an advantage in the duel. He feels like Trophistus is hiding something, and he needs to use every tool he can get to gain an upper hand.
◦ “Trophistus is playing hard, so I must play hard too.”
• They’re talking about this to Veveya
• Ehrugarr asks if they have any notes on Trophistus. Veveya agrees to show Ehrugarr their note-cards.
◦ Ehrugarr si s through them. He is incredibly impressed with the diligence of her notes, especially the specificity on how experienced everyone is in their magic.
◦ He learns a bit more about Trophistus’s economic strategy, but the information on Trophistus’s combat prowess is unclear beyond the fact he uses a katana

• Veveya reveals the field of Magic Identifiers - a field where you can kind of tell what magic a person has by looking really closely at their body
◦ It’s really difficult to get it just by looking, you need to sit them down for a while
◦ The field is underdeveloped, we don’t know a lot about it, and some people doubt how viable they are.
◦ After examining someone, you should be able to generate a code based on their physical traits. This code will lead you to specific conclusions about if a person can use magic.
◦ For example, Veveya’s code is [Code] because she cannot use magic.
◦ They got into it due to their job as a tutor, but it’s a bit inconsistent. You have to really examine someone.
◦ Ehrugarr says they’ve been pretty effective, as their notes line up pretty well to where everyone is at - pointing out Regamirr’s card predicting a lot of her power as an example.
• Ehrugarr gets an idea
◦ “What if we…put your talent to use?”
• Veveya is on board.
◦ She reflects on their own relationship with Trophistus - he could easily be an ally, but his motives can easily be more sinister. Now that Regamirr is out, there’s an argument for Trophistus’s social sway being dangerous if he splinters off from Ehrugarr and Ozapold.
• Veveya asks Ehrugarr to explain further. They agree.
• Cut to black.
———————
• Ehrugarr approaches Trophistus, they want to talk about something.
He wants to talk strategy towards how to navigate the Platore Platoon and how to deal with the fact Trophistus could easily mount on the pair
◦ Ehrugarr, internally, notes that this isn’t untrue, but there’s a deeper reason that places suspicion on Trophistus
• Ehrugarr suggests they and Veveya eat out
◦ “Me and Veveya haven’t eaten all day, and this place has a pretty good food district.”
◦ Just the three of them though
• Trophistus picks the restaurant, since they're in a really good spot for that
◦ Boiling Crater, a restaurant which specializes in Curries and Stews
◦ Popular among tourists
• Trophistus asks if the pair are familiar with the Skychosen Lands’ curry
◦ Both say no
• Trophistus asks Veveya and Ehrugarr if they like spicy food
◦ Ehrugarr doesn’t have it o en, but he’s neutral. He doesn’t mind it.
◦ Veveya is neutral, but she’s similarly not picky.
• Trophistus…nods.
• …
• Ehrugarr hands Trophistus his adventurer’s journal and asks Trophistus to write down where the restaurant is in, and what time.
• Trophistus obliges. He takes Ehrugarr’s journal down, and writes a time and place in it.

——
• …
• Ehrugarr is by himself, in front of the restaurant.
• He looks at the notes Trophistus wrote, and the anonymous note that he confiscated from Veveya.
◦ …
◦ The handwriting is completely different.
◦ Unless they're dealing with a master forger, whoever wrote it wasn’t Trophistus.
• …
• Trophistus and Veveya soon both arrive.
• The three enter the restaurant.
• Ehrugarr looks at the menu sheet on the wall
◦ “Huh, I’ve never seen one of these. This looks complicated.”
◦ “They don’t have any of these in Breizan”
◦ Veveya and Ehrugarr expect that they will have to fill one of these out.
• The three reach the front. A young, perky waitress in a frilly maid outfit greets them
• Trophistus reaches into his hands the lady a sheet which had been filled out beforehand.
◦ “I prepared us tables. The party of three?”
• The lady grabs the menu sheet and accepts it as valid.
◦ “Great!”
◦ “My name is Mimi, and I’ll be your server today!”
• The three sit down at their booth. The table is pretty roomy, with a heater in the center of it
• The three have a brief conversation
• The cute bunny girl arrives with their food on a tray
◦ “Here’s your food! Uwu!”
• The main dish is a bubbling soup in a large bowl.
◦ “Here’s your Volcanosaurus Special!”
◦ Visual description comparable to a lava. It’s a big, red, bubbling pot on a table stove.
◦ The broth of the soup is made from the bones of a Volcanosaur, a monster specific to the Skychosen Lands 
• She also puts a bunch of dishes down for vegetables and meat, surrounding the table.
◦ They get all their food at once. Make sure to include a description for each item.
• Veveya makes a comment about how expensive this must be
◦ Trophistus says he is able to afford it
◦ The waitress perks that there’s a discount if you manage to finish it!
▪ In other words, there’s a penalty if there’s food still on your plate.
◦ Ehrugarr makes a comment about how the meat doesn’t look cooked
• Trophistus scoops himself up some [monster] meat with chopsticks, and drops it in the hotpot bowl for it to cook
◦ [Trophistus talks]
◦ This is one of those places where you need to cook your meat inside of the broth
• Trophistus takes the meat out of the bowl, puts it on his plate, and eats it
◦ Ehrugarr internally realizes this is how hotpot works and why the meat wasn’t cooked.
• Ehrugarr stabs a bit of meat on his skewer and puts it in the pot, while Veveya puts in a radish
◦ [Ehrugarr talks about his time living in the wilderness, and how he had to learn how to heat up food with fire from killing monsters. Heat Sharpened helped, but he wouldn’t be anywhere if he didn’t learn how to make fire from sticks.]
◦ [Trophistus responds and puts in a bit more food]
• Ehrugarr takes out the meat with his chopsticks and eats it
◦ “So, as I was-“

@cg BurningSensation

• AAAAAUUGGGGHKKKK….!
◦ But, Ehrugarr only said that in his head.
◦ The flavor hits all at once
◦ Extremely vivid description of eating spicy food
◦ It is like bitting into an inferno of a thousand suns
◦ An inferno which will be released as soon as he opens his mouth
◦ His eyes are watering, and his vision is clouding
◦ Ehrugarr’s tongue feels like it’s going to bubble down into a pile of grease in his mouth
◦ Ehrugarr is used to spicy food, but this is on another level
◦ A heat is on his tongue, as if it is being burned
◦ Ehrugarr wants to yell, but has to hold it in to feel strong
• “H…k!
• Ehrugarr turns to Veveya, who has also eaten her radish
◦ She isn’t doing much better
• Ehrugarr then turns to Trophistus
◦ Several servings of meat and vegetables cooked by the broth have been heaped up on his plate.
◦ He then sees Trophistus bite into it…and he has no reaction. His cool, collected composure remains with no issues.
• Veveya and Ehrugarr look at this and suspect the same thing.
◦ Was this a trap? Was Trophistus onto them? Did he order this to throw them off?
• Another shot of Trophistus’s maw shoveling food into his mouth.
• Ehrugarr then steels up
◦ Internally “Is this…another battle?”
• Flashback to Pihqura. Didn’t he mention that the spices and peppers are stronger on the Skychosen Lands due to their isolation- the flavors of their dishes amplify tenfold
• Ehrugarr notes that, because of his experience as a merchant, Trophistus is probably familiar with the spices on the Skychosen Lands.
• Ehrugarr instinctively reaches for water, but there isn’t any on table.
• Trophistus asks how the others how their meal is
◦ He’s very cool - “You know…I have always been a connoisseur for spicy food.”
◦ [something about the core traits of spicy food]
◦ “I have had Volcanosaurus before, but I have always had to settle an import dish made in Graddia. Now that I’ve tried the real thing, I can’t say what I’ve had before holds up.”
◦ “Only cooks from the Skychosen Lands know how to cook this, would you agree”
◦ Trophistus notices that Ehrugarr’s plate is empty, so he puts a slice of meat on Ehrugarr’s plate.
◦ “Here.

• Ehrugarr watches Trophistus eat more of it
◦ Ehrugarr questions if Trophistus is even human, there’s no other way that can explain how this can be eaten at the quantities Trophistus is eating at
• Veveya hasn’t touched any food besides the radish, she’s sweating.
• Ehrugarr attempts to grab a piece of meat and eat it
◦ Trophistus corrects Ehrugarr
◦ “That’s raw meat, remember or you’ll get sick.”
• Trophistus asks if Ehrugarr and Veveya are okay, and drops a piece of tofu in the soup. They’ve been acting strangely since they got here.
◦ V: “YOU’RE the one asking that?”
• Ehrugarr decides to lie
◦ “I’m not hungry, I already ate”
◦ This is untrue, but the purpose of the meeting was just to talk to Trophistus. He’d be okay with that, right?
◦ “Hmmmm.”
• Trophistus responds silently, picks up the tofu with his chopsticks
◦ “Really, because I thought you said you hadn’t eaten all day.”
◦ “That’s what you told me, right?”
• Ehrugarr blasts himself for his mistake
◦ “Shit! Why, why did I say that!”
◦ “I gave information away unnecessarily, when I should have kept my mouth shut. If so, then I would have been able to navigate out of this!”
◦ “A rookie mistake, like a overshooting a roundhouse kick!”

• Trophistus sighs.
◦ “Oh well. I must have misjudged. This kind of food is an…acquired taste.”
◦ “I am okay with going to somewhere else, if you guys … still need to eat.”
• Trophistus puts the tofu, cooked by broth, into his mouth and swallows, without breaking eye contact.
• Trophistus then leans down on the table with a smirk.

@cg TrophistusHotpot

“You don’t have to eat this, if you can’t handle it.”

A slash in Ehrugarr’s armor
;death by stupefaction umineko
To Ehrugarr, Trophistus’s smirk stretches across his face with a smug satisfaction
◦ True, he can’t eat any more of this but…
◦ The tone in Trophistus’s voice…The look on Trophistus’s face says it all. To stop here would be conceding this battle.
◦ “No, we can’t just say that we want something else! Then…our cover would be blown! Not after I got caught in that lie!”
◦ “Getting another dish, would that be an admission of distrust?”
◦ “He hung on the word *hunger*…could he suspect that this meeting is being held for some other reason?”
◦ The true purpose of this meeting was to have Veveya scout Trophistus. An admission of Ehrugarr’s true motives, and that Ehrugarr really was planning something with this meeting.
◦ The table is. Surrounded by food, most of which probably wasn’t cheap. That money could have been spent anywhere.
◦ “This isn’t a dojo or a grassy field. It is a restaurant, and there’s nothing else here except food.”
▪ Yes…this is a battlefield like any other

• Ehrugarr responds.
◦ “We can handle this. Trust me!”
◦ Ehrugarr gives a nod to Veveya
◦ V: “Ehrugarr, I hope you know what you’re doing… please don’t over-think this…”
◦ Internally - “That’s right. This is a battle, just like any other I’ve been in! Me and Veveya, versus Trophistus!”
◦ “We may have the advantage in numbers, but this isn’t a fight where we have the upper hand!”
◦ “Every aspect of this was planned by Trophistus, from the restaurant choice to the menu. The pair of them have walked into Trophistus’s den willingly and now have to fight their way out.”
• Dining continues. 
• Ehrugarr, internally realizes he has to think of a plan.
◦ “I can’t throw punches mindlessly. Trophistus clearly has a plan, so I need one too.”
◦ They say human beings reveal their truest selves when under stress. I need to stay…cool and collected in order to win.

▪ Ehrugarr can still feel the first bite linger on his tongue.
▪ If I don’t eat anything, Trophistus is going to get suspicious. Could figuring out a way to bear the heat solve this battle?”
◦ Veveya is in no state to examine Trophistus if she eats the hotpot. Trophistus is definitely hiding something.
◦ It should be easy to call him out…like, “Hey! This dinner is weird!” But, that would put suspicion on me, wouldn’t it?
▪ I’d be throwing my whole weight into a punch, when he can turn it back on me and counter!
◦ Is there a trick that is allowing Trophistus to eat it?
◦ Is the bowl poisoned in some way? Did Trophistus tamper with the dish in some way to keep his cool?
• Ehrugarr looks around the restaurant to other patients
◦ They have…beverages in metallic cups
• Ehrugarr realizes his first move
◦ Of course!
◦ Trophistus didn’t include water on the menu, did he?
◦ If I give Veveya some water, then we’ll be able to eat this food normally, right?
• Ehrugarr suggests drinks and asks for water
• Trophistus apologizes for the lack of water.
◦ “Drinks…?” 
◦ “Hmmm. That’s right. I must have made a mistake on the sheet. I apologize.”
• Trophistus calls over the perky waitress
◦ “Yes! UwU”
• Trophistus apologizes for forgetting drinks, and asks for two mineral waters as well as a [fancy drink].
◦ “Mineral…waters?”
◦ The perky waitress bows
▪ “Of course! UwU”
• Ehrugarr asks about the mineral waters
◦ This place has special water to compliment the spicy food.
• [conversation]
• The waitress has a tray with three drinks on it
◦ The two mineral waters come in metallic cylinder cups, and Trophistus’ drink is a carbonated, minty drink that comes in
a fancier glass with a flower on the rim.
▪ The mineral water is also…blue. An opaque navy blue that can’t be seen through.
◦ Ehrugarr reacts. “That’s….water?”
▪ Ehrugarr is immediately concerned.
▪ “You could put anything in that!”
◦ “Here you are! Two waters and your Breezy Shine!”
• Trophistus thanks the girl, and a drink takes what is apparently a Breezy Shine.
◦ “Oh, and by the way…”
• Trophistus gets out his wallet. He hands the waitress a generous handful of Mynt.
◦ “A tip. You’ve been of great service.”
◦ He then gives a side eye to Ehrugarr.
◦ “I apologize for any inconvenience.”
• The girl gasps. She responds well.
◦ [gasps] “For me!?”
◦ “Oh! Thank you so much!”
• This only, however, makes Ehrugarr more paranoid. He looks at the glasses again.
◦ “Wh-what was with that look?”
◦ Ehrugarr is paranoid that the glasses are spiked in some way and include anything from poison to agitation to the flavor
◦ If that’s the case, then its game over for him and Veveya!
• Ehrugarr questions how the waters could be spiked
◦ The waitress and Trophistus could be in on it! She could be an accomplice!
◦ That was….a LOT of money he just handed her!
◦ Why did he pay her so much for just a tip? What we just saw…could have been her payment!
◦ And how did he get that much money in the first place? Was this just to a showy move to reveal how many resources are under his disposal?
◦ Trophistus could have gone earlier today and talked to her, that’s how he could have planned this!
• Ehrugarr questions what to do
◦ If…that’s the case
◦ Can I trust these waters?
• Snap back to reality
◦ Trophistus is sipping on his drink.
◦ Veveya still hasn’t moved.
• Final move
◦ “That’s right, I can move into a pincer attack! I’ll handle the front, and Veveya can handle the back!”
• Scene over
◦ Trophistus just downs whatever was le in the bowl.
▪ No biggie.
◦ (DAMN I just forgot to finish this scene)

——————

• Veveya and Ehrugarr are alone again. Well, that was a disaster.
They talk about their plan going forward and what they learned.
▪ “There could be pictures of Trophistus elsewhere”
▪ “Cameras are expensive, so don’t expect them to be lying around everywhere”
◦ They didn’t actually eat very much.
◦ Veveya bought both of them Gelato
——————
• Night before the quest. The cast has agreed to unseal this morning.
• Veveya checks out a newspaper and some books about magic identifiers. They feel like this is enough information to dig into Trophistus’s powers.

——————
• Cut to Liburri’s room. Liburri has a peach in her hands
◦ She goes in to eat it…
◦ And this scares her
◦ She crushes the Peach in her hands
◦ “No….no!”
◦ “This…this is wrong!”
◦ “Why…why am doing this? Why am I indulging in the surface world and all its toxins?”
• Liburri shakes herself. Liburri begins to feel an attachment to Deyacron, and that scares her.
◦ “No…I can’t let myself…be poisoned.”
◦ “I can’t forget why I’m here!”
◦ “Deyacron is up to something. She has to! She’s from the surface!”
◦ “She’s leaning me in, and is gonna stab me in the back!”
◦ “I can’t accept this…”
◦ “For my village…for my people.”
◦ “I need to win this game…the right way!”

——————

• Bell Tower is Unsealed
• Challenge begins 
• Rules of challenge are explained
◦ Everyone starts with 300 Fortune Points, the currency unique to Fortune Harvest. Your goal is to collect as many Fortune Points as possible within Fortune Harvest.
▪ There are many different types of vendors within Fortune Harvest. However, this challenge considers the amount of Fortune Points you end with, not total earned.
◦ The time limit is 45 minutes. Afterwards, the challenge will end.
▪ The adventurers feel like that isn’t a lot of time, way shorter than most of the challenges we’ve had so far
◦ Confessional from contestants that are like “wow this is a really luck based challenge, alright then.”
• The challenge begins. The group disperses to run loose in the fairgrounds
• Trophistus gets an early lead at the Card Parlor via his skill at Aquolion Isles style Heart Roller

• Meanwhile, Kennewick enters a card parlor and realizes…she does not know how to play. Any card game.
• They then form a plan.
• They walk up to strangers in the parlor, and begin to make bets on them on the outcomes of matches.
◦ “See the guy with the glassy eye and the guy with the spiky hair playing Heart Roller? I bet you 30 Fortune points that Glassy Eye will win!”
• Trophistus exits the parlor.
• However, the camera pans up. 
• A shadowy figure with a scythe in their hands stands on top of a tall building…watching the adventurers from above.
◦ “….”
•
• We get a check in on Liburri. She’s just generally very disoriented by the whole casino - the bright lights, the noise, the opportunism. Compared to her quiet cave, this is an uncomfortable and oppressive environment for her.
• She runs into like. A scammer type who is trying to con her out of her Fortune Points. And she responds to him by immediately burrowing a hole in the grown and tunneling away.
• Havi is at Rapquawk Betting
• They know nothing about Rapquawk Racing, so they decide to bet on a bird that has a funny name.
• They watch the race, and their bird wins fi h place.
• They make a profit of three Fortune Points.
• After that, Havi is like…
◦ …okay! That’s all for me. That’s it, that’s enough gambling for me today.
• They then leave.
• Ehrugarr goes to an item shop and buys something.
• Deyacron goes to the Battle Arena.
• The Battle Arena is an area where fighters have to wager their ability to beat powerful monsters - the wager goes up with each victory but fully terminates upon defeat.
• Deyacron participates and gets a sizable lead in Fortune Points.
• Scene where adventurer sees something in the corner of their eye, that moved
◦ “What was that?”
• Veveya enters the Card Parlor, and Kennewick is inside.
• Kennewick has just lost a bet, and is very low on points. 
• However, Kennewick seeing Veveya enter the parlor, makes a move. She decides to challenge Veveya to Heart Roller
◦ Veveya does know the rules to Heart Roller, so she takes her up on her deal.
◦ Veveya asks if Kennewick knows, she says she didn’t before today, but learned while watching all these people play. She is absolutely confident.
◦ The crowd ooo’s and aaa’s.
◦ Bets over who wins start popping up. Some people bet Veveya, but most people bet Kennewick.
• The match is largely even, despite Kennewick’s inexperience with Heart Roller.
• However, near the end, Kennewick appears to make a pretty big mistake. Veveya has had a slight upper hand the whole match which Kennewick has ignored, and most of the bets have shi ed towards Veveya’s favor.
• Veveya appears to have Kennewick in check.

• However, Kennewick uses their crappy hand to pull off a surprise attack.
• Veveya notices…something under Kennewick’s sleeve
◦ Something she bought from the store? A card.
• The tavern erupts in cheers, the game now even. Veveya’s win condition is destroyed in an instant, through a surprise attack she was secretly building to. Everything was calculated towards that specific moment.
• Deyacron loses a shit ton of money because of [shenanigans]
• Deyacron stumbles upon Liburri, who is hiding.
◦ Deyacron barely has any money
◦ Deyacron notices Liburri doesn’t have much,
◦ And
◦ Despite everything, Deyacron lends Liburri a fair share of her coins
◦ “There, that should be enough of a start to get you off the ground, right?’

• Deyacron leaves
◦ And this is what BREAKS Liburri and just leaves her a sobbing mess
• Trophistus runs into Ehrugarr
◦ Both have a solid amount of Fortune Points.
• …. 
• Ehrugarr, seeing that neither of them are in danger of elimination, asks Trophistus if he wants to ride the Sky View attraction with him.
◦ Ehrugarr says that he some things he wants to talk about with Trophistus, regarding their future in the game now that it is reaching its halfway point and there is a vacuum of power.
• Trophistus agrees.
◦ He can sense something is up with Ehrugarr, and he wants to disarm it when he has the chance.
———
• Trophistus and Ehrugarr arrive at the Sky View.
• Trophistus and Ehrugarr have to put their bags into a chest locker
◦ Per quota of the Sky View ride.
◦ Ehrugarr grabs Trophistus’s items and his own and puts them into the designated chest. There’s a color coded lock on it, which Ehrugarr sets in front of Trophistus. 
• The two enter their seats in the Sky View.
• When Ehrugarr looks out their window, they can see the entirety of Fortune Harvest from a bird’s eye view.
• It’s a very stunning picture, but the atmosphere in the car is…
• …tense.
————
• The two start their various conversation with small talk.

• Trophistus asks what Ehrugarr’s relationship to Veveya is.
◦ T: “What is your relationship to her…?”
◦ “The two of us are close allies in this game. She has a quiet strength, and I respect that. She’s-”
◦ Trophistus buts in.
◦ T: “Does she you the way you see her…?”
◦ Ehrugarr tenses up.
◦ “No. Never. It has never been like that.”
◦ Trophistus inches in.
◦ T: “Is thaaaat so…?”
◦ “I’d prefer to think of her as a daughter or niece.”
◦ “…..”
◦ T: “You’re going to have to tell her eventually then.”
• Trophistus asks if Ehrugarr has ever had that experience before
◦ “No. I have not found someone I’d choose to settled down with yet.”
• This small talk can’t last forever. There is a palpable unease in the air.
• Now that the air is tense, Ehrugarr asks his leading question: what Trophistus plans to do to win the game.
• Trophistus reveals his plan. It’s a bluff.
• Ehrugarr then makes a claim - Trophistus has a deeper strategy that isn’t being revealed. 
• Ehrugarr bluffs that he has figured out Trophistus’s whole strategy. He’s someone who’s waiting in the background, playing to whoever has power, and is waiting for them to slip up and fail until he only remains. They act as a shield, while he is allowed to hide in the background and accumulate power.
◦ From there, he will easily be able to counter whoever’s le .
◦ As long as there’s no attention on him - he isn’t in the bottom nor the top, his plan will work.
• Ehrugarr commends the plan as well thought out, but that he knows his next move and can act accordingly.
◦ Ehrugarr knows that Trophistus’s ideal final match-up would be the two of them, with Ehrugarr taking out most of the other adventurers and Trophistus building a counter for Ehrugarr specifically in the final match-up.
◦ However…
◦ “It’s not going to work.”
• Ehrugarr calls out Trophistus’s strategy with his katana - that because of his role he’s probably using ice or water powers.
◦ Ehrugarr warns Trophistus that if his battle strategy is using a katana + water magic, he will lose. 
◦ Ehrugarr has experience fighting sword masters with his bare hands, and Trophistus’s katana is too fragile to withstand heat.
◦ “If you end up disarmed, the battle will be over.”
• Trophistus is silent. Poker face. He does not confirm or deny anything.
• Ehrugarr continues.
◦ “This is what I am meeting to tell you.” 
◦ With the information I have, I am warning you now - victory is highly unlikely in your current state. I am letting you know now so you have time to rethink your strategy.”
◦ “However, you and I both want a battle at the end of our journey. I am still willing to work with you to achieve that goal.”
◦ “I just want you to know - you are not as safe as you are. If things take a turn for the worse, you’re going to need a plan”
• …
• Trophistus clutches the hilt of his katana.
◦ Ehrugarr catches it.
▪ “Your sword…” 
• Trophistus confidently smirks.
◦ “And if you’re wrong about me?”
◦ “And if you’ve miscalculated, and this whole confrontation is based on incomplete information?
• Ehrugarr is quiet.
◦ “Then this was a losing move. It would be an error as if I missed a punch and you retaliate during the heat of battle.”
◦ “I will own up to that.”
• Ehrugarr regains his posture.
◦ “So.”
◦ “If we’re serious about this, if we do work together…”
◦ “It is only fitting we learn more about each other, right?”
• Trophistus li s an eyebrow.
◦ “We know plenty about each other.”
◦ Ehrugarr shakes his head.
• Ehrugarr asks Trophistus to reveal his goals
◦ “Are your intentions with Ozapold and the others? Or, do you have something else in mind?”
◦ “I have to ask, who are you, Trophistus Sumulong?”
◦ “Tell me everything.”
• Trophistus bounces the question back at Ehrugarr.
◦ “We’ll trade. It’s only fair in a game like this, right?”
◦ He agrees
• Ehrugarr elaborates on his own goals
◦ He wants to fight a strong opponent
◦ Once he achieves that, there is no need to continue the Pilgrimage
◦ He does not consider himself a leader or someone who would do well in a position of power - he’s just someone who
lives for the thrill of battle
• Trophistus probes him
◦ A lot of it is tied to Ehrugarr’s sense of self worth
◦ He wants to relive a past
• Trophistus asks if this has anything to do with Sun Sharpened Spirit
◦ Ehrugarr agrees - he needs to keep the lost civilization of the Sun Sharpened Spirit alive by being strong. He’s the only person le after the death of his mentor - and if he lets Sun Sharpened Spirit die, it will be dead forever.
◦ As long as he can still cast magic, the civilization will be alive. As long as he is strong, the civilization will be alive.
◦ The weight of an entire civilization rests on his shoulders, and the Pilgrimage shall be his stage.
◦ He’s failed that goal for the past ten years, but he shall finally set things right with this victory.
◦ “Power is useless if you can’t use it to help those who are important to you.”
• Trophistus responds
◦ “What were you taught about this civilization?”
◦ “Were you taught about the clothes they wore?”
◦ “Do you know the taste of any foods they ate? “
◦ “What they did they do on their days off? Which ones were those special celebrations that only came once a year?”
◦ “Did you learn about any of the songs they sung? How they danced to their music?”
◦ “Would you happen to be able to tell me any of those things?”
◦ “Or…did you only learn their fighting style?”
◦ “There are many ways to keep a civilization alive, even if none of its members are around.”
◦ “So…why Sun Sharpened Spirit?
◦ “Is that really the only thing that survived your lost civilization?”
• Ehrugarr is silent
◦ “….”
• Trophistus makes another point
◦ Many civilizations exist - we’re stronger when we band together with other people, that’s just how humans are.
◦ However, there is only one winner of this Pilgrimage. One person who will gain the authority of {zenith_name}.
◦ If your civilization can only survive based on victory…
◦ A single person’s victory…
◦ What will happen if you lose the Pilgrimage?
◦ Will that elimination cause the civilization of the Sun Sharpened Spirit…to finally be killed?
• Ehrugarr…is silent.
◦ Hopefully…it won’t come to that point.
• Trophistus requests Ehrugarr to find a better answer.
◦ He is fully willing to make that sacrifice.
◦ Everyone here has agreed, by the contract that binds them to the game.
◦ Fourteen people will fail, and one will succeed. Even if it’s not by his hand, the results will still end up the same.
◦ Regardless of if it’s not him, someone here is going to kill the final memories of the people of the Sun Sharpened Spirit - it
could be him, or Yunyere, or Deyacron, or even Veveya.
◦ So, Trophistus gives Ehrugarr a warning.
◦ While he’d prefer it not to be him, Trophistus is committed to his path. He is fully willing to dirty his hands and “destroy” the final remnants of the Sun Sharpened Spirit’s people if the alternative is losing this game to Ehrugarr and being unable to achieve his own goals.
◦ So, he requests Ehrugarr find a different answer. A different conviction that could actually challenge his own.
• ….
• Ehrugarr, having now revealed the full scope of his aspirations, asks Trophistus to respond in turn.
◦ Trophistus agrees.
• Trophistus responds with the same motive he gave at the very start of the game: to give the Graddian Trade Market good press.
He wants what’s best for the people.
• Ehrugarr calls his bluff.
◦ “No, that’s not it.”
◦ “You’re not like Yunyere, you have deeper motives.”
◦ “If that’s all there is to it, then I should be the one challenging you to find a conviction that can stand up to mine.”
• “…”
• Trophistus smirks. He turns towards the window of the Sky View, down at Fortune Harvest.
◦ “You are correct, things are more complex than that.”
• Trophistus reveals his goals - he does want what is best for the people. But, it’s not exactly as he said. 
◦ He wants to build a new Graddia where every man, strong and weak, is truly equal.
• Trophistus elaborates on his position within Graddia.
◦ He is the chief executive of Graddia’s Sea Trade District.
◦ Hundreds of people rely on his leadership in order to get the resources they need to live their lives - metals from Platore’s mines, wood from Graddia’s lumber, and ores from Breizan’s deserts. Food, clothing, livestock, the materials necessary to learn magic.
◦ And, this will only become greater and greater. To keep up with Rule of Strength, all three land continents are demanding more and more resources to expand their empires, to become the strongest.
◦ He is someone who people must rely on to make decisions. And he is used to making difficult decisions, because Graddia is not a land with enough resources for everyone.
• Trophistus looking through the window, asks Ehrugarr what he thinks of Fortune Harvest, the casino.
◦ Ehrugarr says that it is like a carnival - a bright fun place you go for a week, and then go back home.
• Trophistus…does not agree.
◦ “Maybe it once was, if you buy the pitch of those who want you to get hooked on Somni pipes.”
◦ He considers Fortune Harvest a place “ruled by greed and suffering.”
◦ He asks Ehrugarr if he’s seen any beggars. Many people have resorted to putting food on the table through the same Fortune Points they’ve spent tooth and nail gambling for.
◦ Fortune Harvest is also one of the highest profile institutions of publicly available Somni Therapy. Many people who live here are rich, but if you’re lucky enough, you can foot the bill for a false, new life by buying Somni Therapy using Fortune Points.
◦ People’s entire lives…dependent on the rigged roll of the dice.
◦ Trophistus finds this place, Fortune Harvest, to be absolutely disgusting.
• Trophistus elaborates.
◦ “It reminds me of…home.”
◦ “The golden hills of Graddia - that kind-hearted, disgusting casino.”
◦ Trophistus elaborates - Graddia is a place that runs on power and the value it sees in people.
◦ It is a place where those who lucky reach the top, while subjugating the weak and abusing their power. You’re either subjugated, or the one doing the subjugating.
◦ “Those loyal to Graddia are no different from those who love Fortune Harvest because of the false realities it sells them.”
◦ “I’ve see a lot of the Skychosen Lands in Graddia. But perhaps it’s the other way around. Graddia is trying to emulate what we see here.”
◦ It’s not just Graddia, either. It’s bigger than that - Platore, Breizan, all of these societies which {zenith_name} has created. All of them corrupted to their core - rotten casinos covered in gold.
◦ “And…about Graddia.”
• Trophistus reaches into his pocket and takes out…a crumpled up letter.
• That handwriting…
• This is clearly a different letter, but the frantic and scribbled handwriting is the same.
◦ “I received a present from a certain prince after Qujeon le .”
◦ “He spent his time writing something, just for me.”
◦ “Would you like to read it?”
• Ehrugarr says yes, accepting . 
• Ehrugarr reads it, bracing himself for what to expect.
◦ It is an angry rant towards Trophistus, calling him a villain that is out to get Yunyere.
◦ Ehrugarr finds out what Trophistus did that challenge - how he trapped Qujeon and Yunyere in an area of the labyrinth they could only escape with the Warp Stone.
◦ He is called cowardly, someone who violated Qujeon, and someone out to get Graddia’s future as well as Yunyere.
◦ Veveya is also name-dropped several times as a possible co-conspirator.
• Trophistus smiles, wryly.
◦ “I presume Veveya got one of her own.” 
◦ “The true face of Graddia is in your hands, it appears. What do you have to say?”
• Ehrugarr shakes his head.
◦ “I’ve… had a lot of time to think about what transpired that day.”
◦ “But…I stand by my decision to save Veveya, even ignoring my alliance with her.”
◦ “She was the only one who talked to me. She was dealt a poor hand, and managed to scrape by what should have been an easy loss.”
◦ “She’s not the mightiest of us, but she has an incredibly strong heart. She deserves a place in this game as a Zenith candidate, just like you and I do.”
◦ “Meanwhile, Qujeon…”
◦ “He’s someone a lot of people like. I wasn’t particularly close to him, but he seemed like a nice enough person.”
◦ “However, I certainly don’t like to say this but…”
◦ “That was a really risky move, you know that? If your stunt with the rocks didn’t work out, Qujeon could have locked you off from almost everyone else’s trust. You’d be over, then and there.”
◦ “Even now, I’m not confident you made the right choice to commit that early. Yunyere and Deyacron are two of the most powerful pieces in the game, but your actions against Qujeon have alienated them from wanting to work with you, and now your only option is to wait for them to go away.”
◦ “But, that didn’t happen. And I’m guessing that read of him is why you acted.”
◦ “Because his elimination that episode was a result of several decisions. Not turning back to cash in his treasure when he had the chance, not talking to people outside his alliance. Not communicating with his allies with the vote.”
◦ “I wouldn’t have been happy about losing my treasure, but there was enough time in the challenge to still salvage things. Staying down that lower level to find an unknown exit…is that optimism, or is that greed?”
◦ “There’s an argument that the “just” decision would have been Veveya. But, I don’t know. I don’t think I ever fully bought Qujeon’s narrative."
“Though….Yunyere. I always did get concerning vibes from the kid...”
◦ “Not always. But more recently. And this ended up validating a lot of those feelings.”
• Trophistus continues his point.
◦ He’s been seeing it more and more as he travels through the Skychosen Lands - there is a lot of Graddia here, no, the other way around. Graddia is trying to emulate the Skychosen Lands, to have what it has.
◦ What the Skychosen Lands has - a Zenith.
• This is why Graddia is corrupt.
◦ Graddia values the strong, and only the strong. “Strength is an illusion, yet this world is not kind to those it deems weak.”
◦ No man is equal there. The weak, sick, and unextraordinary must rely on heroes, worship them, give them all your possessions.
◦ That is why the royal kingdom is corrupt, that foundation which must be removed.
◦ Unless that changes, the common man of Graddia can never choose for themselves.
◦ He has seen first hand how the Royal Kingdom does things, from the few times his role as Chief of the Graddian Sea Market has intersected them.
◦ Graddia has a castle and Royal Family. Yet, it is no longer a particularly wealthy nation.
◦ He has personally acted as an adviser to the Royal Family, and he’s seen the way they have let him spend the country’s limited resources.
◦ They want a {zenith_name}.
◦ Based on his own estimation, he judged it will take at most five years for Graddia’s economy to completely collapse in on itself to the point of becoming unsustainable. With Yunyere in the picture, he’d now say it’s about two years.
◦ When that does happen, it is incredibly unlikely that the Royal Family will be the ones who will face the consequences of this collapse.
• But…
◦ Graddia is a pyramid that Trophistus has been trying to climb for years now. He’s gotten lucky, he’s done some things he isn’t proud of, but it has all been in the name of getting the people of Graddia to prosper.
◦ And it’s all coming to and end soon.
◦ Because, with the miracle of being chosen for the Pilgrimage, and the authority of Zenith he just needs to obtain…
◦ …he’s now this close.
• Ehrugarr pauses. “This close?”
• The sky view reaches the top of the tower.

• Trophistus turns back to Ehrugarr
◦ “When I stand among all the other powers of the world…”
◦ “When they see me as Zenith, and recognize me as such…”
◦ “I’ll take everything {zenith_name} has built…”
" ◦ “This whole system. Everything."
◦ “I’ll take it all.”
• He leans close to Ehrugarr. There’s a twisted grin on 
◦ “And burn it down until only the ashes remain.”
• “….”
◦ “….”
• Trophistus leans back to his original position. His composure returns to normal
◦ “In other words, it’s just as I said in the beginning. I want what’s best for the people.”
◦ “But, it is impossible for this path to be made without blood and tears. It requires many, many hard choices.”
◦ “If the powerless cannot make those choices by themselves, if going against this society of heroes and Rule of Strength will brand them as villains, then I shall be the one follow down that path and bear those hard choices in their place.”
◦ “If everything I must choose comes to pass, it is unlikely people will have kind things to say about me when I die. I will eventually be remembered in disgrace, and I have accepted that.”
◦ “In all of the breadth of human society, among all the conflicting beliefs our nations can take, there is no culture in world that wants to engender betrayal as something its citizens value.”
◦ “So. If Graddia’s weakest won’t have to be caught with that dishonor, if there only needs to be one person strong enough to carry that betrayal, there will be no burdens when it is their turn to take from the dinner table.
◦ “That way, Graddia will be a land with no heroes where everyone is equal.”
◦ “Did that answer your question.”
• Ehrugarr…doesn’t know what to think.
◦ Does Trophistus truly believe all this?
◦ A lot of this hinges on a promise of a future he cannot see.
◦ Or is he just spinning conjecture to get Ehrugarr on his side, hollow words from someone playing a cunning politician’s game?
• And then, he speaks.
• Ehrugarr does not fully agree with Trophistus’s plan.
◦ “You’ve…thought about the consequences, have you not?” 
◦ “Of cultures, of power. In your world, heroes and the the strong cannot exist.”
◦ “Yet, your plan involves you taking in all the necessary evils of the Pilgrimage into yourself.”
◦ “Much like how {zenith_name} has become all the good in the world centered at one peak…”
◦ “The mountain of this world would have all its villainy burdened into a single point at the top - yourself.”
◦ “Villain or not, the only strong person le would be you.”
◦ “I’m sorry. But I do not think your dream of wanting Graddia to prosper and dream of winning the Pilgrimage can co exist.”
• “….”
• Trophistus turns back to the wall.
◦ “…Alright, then. That is fine. Your choice is your own.”
◦ “Then, if that means you have chosen to be my enemy
• Ehrugarr interrupts.
◦ “-I never said anything of the sort.”
◦ “Trophistus, more than ever, I want to continue to remain your ally.”
◦ Ehrugarr, though fundamentally opposed to Trophistus’s ideas and its implications for his victory, still wants to fight alongside Trophistus.

• He continues.
◦ “You are someone I still respect a lot, Trophistus.”
◦ “I do not know if I am wrong.”
◦ “But, the means of answering this debate has been presented in front of us - a competition with only one destined winner.”
◦ “Which one of us is incorrect?”
◦ “Which one of us is right?”
◦ “Will you see the end of your journey? Or will I restore honor to the civilization of the Sun Sharpened Spirit? Both of those things can’t happen.”
◦ “If you are {zenith_name}, the world you create is one in which my way of life cannot exist in. If I am {zenith_name}, the world I create cannot be the one you’ve spent everything try to create, either.”
• Ehrugarr extends his arm outwards, and opens his hand. 
◦ “So let us bet on the result.”
◦ “Whose ideology will win? Which one of is correct?”
◦ “Both of us are trying to find those answers. We will find out when we reach the Spring in our final battle.”
◦ “So, do you want to be my enemy? Or shall we create that final battle, in union?”
◦ “Because I cannot think of anyone better I’d rather share the end of the game with than you.”
• Trophistus looks at Ehrugarr’s hand, and shakes it without hesitation.
◦ “Alright. I accept the conditions of your deal.”
• The car reaches the ground.
• Ehrugarr confessional.
◦ Ehrugarr thanks Trophistus for answering his questions.
◦ “He’s probably my number one ally right now, and also my greatest obstacle in the game. I need to follow him to reach my ending, but he’s still my enemy. I can’t just hand him the win, I need to make sure I can win against him.”
◦ Ehrugarr promises Trophistus a final battle he won’t forget.
——————
• Ehrugarr and Trophistus return to the locker room to get their stuff back from the chest.
• Trophistus decides to get it. He walks up to the chest’s color lock.

@cg Lock1

• Trophistus asks Ehrugarr for the combination.
◦ “It’s Blue, Red, Green, Red, Pink, Yellow. If I'm remembering right.”
◦ “Press the buttons until that order of colors come up.”
• Trophistus presses down on the buttons until the colors match.
….

@cg Lock2

The chest does not budge.
• Trophistus looks annoyed. Trophistus puts the combination in again.
….

@cg Lock2

No dice. It fails.
• This prompts Ehrugarr takes a look to see if the chest is busted.
◦ He puts in the combination himself.
◦ Red, Blue…
...
◦ Red, Blue, Pink, Brown, Yellow, Green…
...
◦ Red, Blue, Pink…
◦ Red,, Blue, Pink, Brown, Yellow…


@cg Lock3

• Chnk! The chest opens without a problem.
• Ehrugarr gets his stuff from the chest.
◦ “I think I get it. Green’s at the end, and the paint on the brown panel faded.”
• Trophistus says nothing.
◦ ….
• Ehrugarr sighs, it’s a junky old lock anyways. He almost forgot the combination because of how the colors aren’t in rainbow order. Brown is a weird color to include in general, and it doesn’t make sense for green to be at the end.
◦ Trophistus: …I see. My mistake, then.
• Ehrugarr and Trophistus get the challenge conclusion message
• The message suddenly cuts off in a garbled jam
◦ “…?”
• Fade to black
@cg BlackScreen

——————————————

Liburri reveals the truth to Deyacron, she was the one who sabotaged her in the challenge
◦ She’s afraid of what Deyacron is doing to her. She’s experiencing impulsiveness for the first time.
◦ She’s scared of what this will mean once she returns to the cave, that there’s gonna be something she wants that she can’t bring with her when the journey ends.
◦ She does want to return to the cave with these feelings in tact, so she will do anything to get rid of them, before its too late…
◦ So…
◦ If Liburri made Deyacron go, then she could continue the Pilgrimage without a poisoned mind
◦ She could truly be {zenith_name}
◦ “You’re the one who fed me the peach! You’re the one who is keeping me on the surface! You’re the root of this poison! It’s your…your….”

• Deyacron is silent in all of this.

◦ “…Liburri.”
• She puts on Liburri shoulder.
◦ “It’s okay, you-“
• Liburri instinctively swats it back.
• Liburri then sobs and realize what she’s done
◦ “Oh goddesses, what have I done to you!”
◦ “I…”
◦ “I’m so sorry!”
◦ “I…I can’t stay on the surface any more! I can’t do this to you!…I…”
• Liburri doesn’t know what to do, then runs away.
• Deyacron, shocked by…all of this, chases after her.
◦ “Wait! Come back!”
◦ “Liburri! LIBURRI!”

——————

• Liburri runs into an abandoned area of the park.
• She then throws away all of her coins in a sewer.
◦ “Deyacron…shouldn’t have to suffer, because of my own mistakes!”
◦ “If anyone should have to fight in this duel, it should be me, not her!”
• Liburri is in an alley.

• She’s completely by herself.
• …
• She turns around, and…
• There is a man with a hunched back, behind her.
◦ The figure is cloaked head to toe in black, and has a mask.
• Liburri looks at them.
• And then, as soon as they blink…
• The man is gone.
• Who, was that?
• …
• Liburri is about to run away. To be done with the challenge once and for all.
• But…
• She feels something.
• It’s beneath her feet. She feels something, rising beneath her.
• It’s…wet.
• Liburri looks below her.
• Water, water that glistens like the stars, is now up to her feet.
• She hears something.
• It’s faint, but it’s getting louder and louder.
• The water is rising.
• The water is rising, rapidly!
• That sound…
• It sounds like a Tidal Wave!
• Star-salted water is pouring in from the alley. It’s now up to her ankles.
• Liburri tries to run forward, but she can’t move. She calls out for someone, anyone! But nobody can hear her!
• The water keeps on flowing in. It is now a torrent.
• It is up to her waist.
• She tries to make a leap for it, but the force of the flood pushes her in!
• She’s trying to get out by herself! This flood, it’s far beyond what the brand can heal!
• She tries to swim, but she never learned how. She’s trying to stay above the surface for as long as she can.
• The ground beneath her, she can no longer feel the ground beneath her.
• Is she floating upwards, or, is the ground vanishing under her feet?
• The torrent is too strong, and Liburri’s muscles give out. She can’t see any part of the casino, only the water.
• Liburri can’t move.
• She feels herself losing consciousness, like she’s sinking into a bed that is trying to pull her deeper and deeper down.
• She feels herself…
• Sinking…
• Sinking….
• Sinking.
• ….
• The screen blurs.
• And fades to black.

————————

• Four of the contestants wake up, by themselves.
◦ Yunyere, Uelgwold, Ozapold, and Kennewick
• They are in the Fortune Harvest Fairgrounds, the ballroom at the entrance.
• The sky outside is dark, and void-like, as if the world has been trapped in a gray stasis.
• The four try to look for other adventurers.
• But, it’s no use.
• No matter where they look in the ballroom, nobody else is there. Not Havi, not JQ3, not Veveya, not anyone.
• It appears it’s just the four of them.
◦ Kennewick: “Are the four of us in purgatory? It’s about time I’m rewarded for my evil!”
• What…happened to everyone?
• They eventually enter a dark room with a dinner table
◦ 16 seats… 7 seats on the long sides, and one on each on the end.
◦ Fancy candles cover the table, unlit
◦ There is also a bunch of fancy food on the table
◦ Pihqura is sitting down on one end, not moving
◦ There is a dome plate in the center of the table
◦ Someone moves over to check on Pihqura
• Uelgwold gives Pihqura a shove, and Pihqura falls over
◦ He hits the floor…and they see it
◦ A gaping wound in Pihqura’s back
◦ Is Pihqura…dead?
◦ Everyone is super on edge.
• Uelgwold li s the dome is li ed over the plate
◦ Ten brooches…covered in blood.
◦ The colors no longer glow, but…there’s no doubt.
◦ Veveya, Trophistus, JQ3, Deyacron, Liburri, Ehrugarr, Havi…
◦ Even some colors they don’t recognize. 
▪ Even…Qujeon, Regamirr, and Culpex.
◦ Everyone FREAKS the fuck out.
• Everyone proceeds to freak the fuck out.
◦ Ozapold picks up the deep blue one, and the ocean blue one. The deep blue one is covered in gray blood.
▪ Ozapold is PISSED. He swears vengeance on whoever did this.
• Suddenly, all the candles light up
◦ A figure that wasn’t there before appears on the side opposite of Pihqura’s chair
◦ A…specter-like figure, floating in the air. Their skull-like face is encased in a bubble of glass, and the tatters of their black cloak form into tendrils like a deep sea jellyfish.
• The specter introduces himself
◦ He is…the Abyss Phantom.
◦ And he announces himself as the new host of the Pilgrimage
◦ The Abyss Phantom equips their scythe.
• What is happening is explained
◦ We are not in reality.
◦ They have been swallowed by the Abyss Phantom’s Eternal Dream - in a state between life and death.
◦ Everyone’s bodies were destroyed when the Abyss Phantom flooded Fortune Harvest, but the spirits of these four lingered. Their physical forms in this dream have been recreated with Somni.
• So, what now?
◦ The continued survival of these four will be depend on if they survive the Abyss Phantom’s trials.
▪ Everyone is confused, but also too scared to ask questions.
◦ The Abyss Phantom points into the sky, a blinding white light is above the surface of the water where the sun would be.
▪ This is not a stable dream, and a ri is ripping a hole in this reality. The Abyss Phantom estimates it will erupt in
thirty minutes.
▪ “This ri is being caused by an entity out of my control. If you want to survive, you need to destroy it.“
▪ The first step the survivors need to do is to find the Silver Harpoons. There are four harpoon guns hidden somewhere in Fortune Harvest, and their bullets the only thing powerful enough to this entity. Without the Silver Harpoons, the survivors have a zero percent chance of winning the challenge.
▪ The Abyss Phantom’s minions are all over the fairgrounds. The Abyss Phantom notes that he has analyzed each of the four’s battle statistics, and that the chances of any four at their current level beating even the lowest level Specter is zero percent.
▪ “I do not discriminate between those of who you with endurance or those with strength - everyone will be able to pass my test.”
▪ The Abyss Phantom goes as far as to say that attacking his ghosts would be akin to suicide, there are no tricks in his words.
◦ Once the group finds the Silver Harpoons, he will explain what to do next and more details on the entity causing the rift in reality.
◦ They say one more thing, before leaving the four to their own devices - “Be on your best behavior.”
• The room the four are in melt as their vision blurs, and when they regain their senses, the four are in the courtyard of Fortune Harvest.

• Fortune Harvest…
◦ Has been fully submerged underwater.
◦ They are still standing on the floor, and they can still breathe, but there is no mistake - they are underwater.
◦ Deep ocean plants are growing all over the buildings, reclaimed by the ocean.
◦ It is incredibly dark, with all light coming from the bioluminescent plants and the ri in the sky.
• The four start by arguing what to do, they’re panicking
◦ The group find out they have none of their normal inventories, and only have on them what they were carrying in Fortune Harvest.
◦ Ozapold in particular feels super guilty that all of this happened under his nose, with the knowledge that JQ3, Veveya, Havi, and the others could have perished while he was their leader.
◦ What the Abyss Phantom is saying could easily be a trap
◦ The group eventually decides to go with it, since they have no other options besides sitting and waiting for the rift’s light to take them
• The group start by looking in the arena, as that is the place most likely to have weapons
◦ They have to fend off some ghosts - monstrous jellyfish floating through the ocean.
◦ It’s an incredibly tricky fight and it’s completed incredibly sloppily, but they’re all able to cross once they all run away.
• The dynamic of the group is established.
◦ It’s a clash of egos between Ozapold and Kennewick.
◦ Kennewick’s plans are all super risky and dangerous, and Ozapold vetoes most of them to prevent any further casualties.
◦ Yunyere, on the other hand, doesn’t argue, but doesn’t listen to either of them. He does his own thing, and doesn’t follow directions.
◦ Uelgwold is kind of isolating himself from the group and not communicating with anyone. He already can’t communicate naturally with the others, but the circumstances only extenuate these issues.
• The group is able to make it to the arena, but only after a significant amount of time - time they don’t have.

◦ They go into the arena and find…nothing. Nothing that resembles four harpoon guns.
• The group realizes they shouldn’t fight back through the arena, and the next viable place is the Locker Rooms and Sky View based on distance.
• The route to the Sky View is much more intense - the route is guarded by high level Specters in the shape of sharp toothed piranhas.
◦ No matter what they do, the Specters will only take one damage at a time. Uelgwold does most of the work to fend them off, as Ozapold and Kennewick’s attacks only agitate them. Yunyere’s attacks straight up do nothing, so he’s having trouble keeping up.
◦ Kennewick’s plans get increasingly more dangerous and risky. They’re insistent on proving their strength, and that Ozapold considers them a load. There’s tension between Kennewick’s pushes more and more for her time saving plans.
◦ Ozapold argues that they shouldn’t fight through the Specters because of their high level. Kennewick argues they are on the correct path BECAUSE the Specters are getting stronger.
• Uelgwold just decides to charge through it, in the middle of Kennewick and Ozapold arguing. Yunyere nervously decides to run through it, and feels visibly unprepared. They don’t know where the Sky View is, so they’re following the group.
• The group is uncoordinated. Uelgwold and Kennewick are the first to make it back, then Ozapold.
• A head count of three. Ozapold looks back.
• Yunyere is le behind, right in the middle of the piranha infested road.
◦ They have seen him, and they are swimming towards him.
• Ozapold runs all the way back to Yunyere to save him. He calls for Yunyere to reach his hand out. But…it’s too late.
◦ By the time Yunyere notices Ozapold, the a piranha unleashes its jaws and bites into Yunyere’s neck.
◦ Yunyere is fatally injured, and fizzles away.
◦ All that’s le behind is his brooch, which is le behind in Ozapold’s hands.
◦ Uelgwold grabs Ozapold, and is forced to drag him out at risk of his own safety.
• The group react.

◦ Uelgwold, as usual, growls High Aquolion profanities
◦ Kennewick feels bad over having to abandon Yunyere, but what else was she supposed to do?
——

• The group proceeds into the locker room of the Sky View
• In the middle of the table, there is a box.
• Uelgwold opens the box.
◦ Inside are three Silver Harpoons.
• The Abyss Phantom appears. They have successfully found the four Silver Harpoons, so now the group has a fighting chance.
◦ Ozapold asks where the Specter that’s causing this is, now that they’re equipped, they’re no match for the group.
• The Abyss Phantom pauses.
• The Abyss Phantom explains what’s causing the ri .
◦ “What stands in front of you are the Silver Harpoons, the guns I put in this world with the power to kill especially powerful and dangerous entities made of Somni.”
◦ “One of you was secretly a fake whom I let infiltrate your group. A doppelganger I created in the image of their real life counterpart I’ve already disposed of. I’ve been able to spy everything you’ve done through their eyes.”
◦ “Their existence is caused anomalies in this world, and what was supposed to be its sun is going to ri apart. Your final challenge is to find and dispose of them, and hand me their brooch. That way, I’ll be able to close the rift.”
◦ “The four Silver Harpoons share only a single bullet, which does and doesn’t exist in the one you carry. In this dream, whichever gun fires first is the gun with the bullet in it. You only have one shot.”
◦ “You shall escape once you hand me a brooch. The next steps of your fate will be decided from there.”
◦ “And, impostor…”
◦ “If it isn’t your brooch in my hands, consider it an absolute victory.”


• The Abyss Phantom Vanishes.
• Ozapold commands everyone to touch the tip of the gun’s bullets
• Kennewick says that that won’t work, because everyone is a Somni right now. The reaction will be the same regardless of if we’re Somni or a real person, this is a dream.
• Tempers flare up. It becomes apparent that nobody will leave the room until the culprit is found.
• Ozapold claims that there is no fake, Kennewick is insistent that they find the fake or risk annihilation, and Uelgwold continues not to take a side.
• Tempers flare up. Uelgwold makes the argument that Kennewick could be the fake, because she could be sabotaging the group into making riskier decisions.
• He then blames Kennewick for working with the Abyss Phantom
◦ Kennewick laughs, and says they WISH they could pull off a stunt as elaborate as this. It is simply out of their ballpark.
◦ Kennewick blames Uelgwold and says they are deflecting to hide their own lies, or the lies of Ozapold.
• Ozapold does not vocalize agreement or disagreement. They don’t know what to think, after what happened to Yunyere
• But, he sees the point in it, and does not say anything when Uelgwold raises their harpoon gun towards Kennewick.
• The rift above the surface is getting brighter, the top of the Sky View is already being consumed by light. There’s not a lot of time left.
• Kennewick blows up at Ozapold

◦ They yell at him to get a grip, and nobody got hurt, and that he’s taking everything too seriously.
◦ In fact, there’s an argument that he’s the impostor, because Ozapold’s strategy could be to waste everyone’s time long enough for the rift to consume all. Even now, he is INSISTENT on stalling out the result, and there’s nobody else the impostor could be!
▪ “And do you want to know why I’m confident you’re causing this?”
▪ “Because NONE OF THIS IS REAL!”
▪ “THIS. IS. ALL. PART. OF. THE-“
• Ozapold shoots Kennewick
◦ They let out a shocked screech before fizzling away like Yunyere did, and their brooch drops onto the floor.
• Ozapold didn’t know what happened, they instinctively pulled the trigger and were paranoid.
• Uelgwold says nothing.
• Ozapold solemnly hands the Abyss Phantom Kennewick’s brooch.
◦ They apologize to the Abyss Phantom, and Yunyere and Kennewick if they made the wrong choice.
◦ Uelgwold says nothing.
• The Abyss Phantom erupts two doors from the ground. Their job in this world is done, and it’s time to move onto the next. Whether it will be a good or bad world is up to the future to decide.
• The doors open. Ozapold and Uelgwold enter their respective doors, leaving this sunken underworld behind. 
• The doors break apart and the ri in the sky erupts, the light consuming everything in an instant.
• Cut to black.


@cg BlackScreen
...

• We’re…
• …back to the first room of the ballroom again.
• We see someone wake up from their seat.
◦ It’s Liburri.
• She’s incredibly concerned and scared, why she’s in a ballroom that’s grayscale in color.
• She looks around the ballroom, and finds two other people.
◦ Deyacron, who is relieved to see her okay.
◦ Veveya, who looks frazzled and confused.
• The three try to look for more survivors.
• Liburri gets on fours and begins sniffing for the scent of anyone familiar.
• She only senses one, she runs to one of the tables, and li s the cloth upwards.
• Resting under the table they find…
◦ Kennewick, who is awake.
• Kennewick is just as confused as everyone else on what’s happening. Based on their dialogue, they feel this is their first time in this ballroom.
◦ They look frustrated, and cursing up a storm that they’ve been hidden under a table instead of a place more dignified and worthy.
• All of them try to remember what got them here, but none of them have any memories beyond being in Fortune Harvest and being attacked.
• They decide to enter the dining room.

——

• Cut back to the dining room. It’s empty.
• The door opens. We see someone enter the room.
◦ It’s Trophistus.
• He is soon followed by three other people - Ehrugarr, Havi, and JQ3.
• The three of them wonder where they are. They wonder the same things the other group did.
• They notice the table.
• JQ3 li s up the dome above the plate, and finds the brooches.
• JQ3 examines the brooches. Something about them is…curious.
• The Abyss Phantom appears, to explain the rules their quest to them.

——

• JQ3, Veveya, Trophistus, and Havi are a bit off-put by the rules, especially with the implication all other adventurers are gone.
◦ JQ3 assures the group that there’s no way the Abyss Phantom is telling the truth, they’re only bluffing. They need to hold their head high.

• The group decides to go to the Sky View first, as that will provide the best vantage point to look for possible areas where the Silver Harpoons could be
• The route to the Sky View is difficult.
◦ This route is blocked by ghosts shaped like overgrown coral and anemone, planted on the ground. Mutated, overgrown, stretching outwards and biting with human shaped mouths.

◦ Veveya shoots a fire bullet at the anemone.
◦ The bullets pass straight through. Normal tactics will be ineffective.
• The group finds the Sky View’s entrance to be blocked off.
• However, in the Sky View’s locker room, there’s a treasure chest.
• Ehrugarr opens it. Inside.
◦ 12 special bullets and a special gun.
◦ It’s a singular gun and is a rusted Bronze, and none of the bullets are shaped like harpoons.
◦ These…probably are not the weapons they are looking for.
• They aren’t the Silver Harpoons, but they could be useful
• The room suddenly fills with coral monsters.
◦ Shit, they were following them!
• The other three are outside, but Ehrugarr is still in the room with the treasure chest.
• There’s not enough time for him to reach the others. This room is going to collapse, with him inside.
• He decides to throw the gun to Trophistus.
◦ “Here! Use this, if you want to win!”
• Ehrugarr uses Sun Sharpened Spirit, to get the ghosts attention.
◦ He orders them to run.
• The three are rushed out by JQ3, and the locker room falls apart as the monsters attack, with Ehrugarr trapped inside.
• ….
• The three run, and find a safe place near a bench. They’ve outrun the coral monsters.
• The gang reflects on the sea monster ghosts.
◦ JQ3 realizes that melee attacks and normal weapons wont work, so to what they know, all three are useless.
◦ However, the treasure chest they opened has special bullets that should work against the Specters if push comes to shove

• JQ3 requests to gain access to the gun. The gun looks incredibly rusted, and she should be able to upgrade it to fire faster and more powerfully.
◦ Trophistus gives it to her.

• JQ3 is done with adjustments to the gun. She gives it to Trophistus.
• Havi suddenly interjects.
• They request to be the one that holds onto the gun. They’re certainly not the strongest fighter in the Pilgrimage. But of the three of them, they’re the best marksman. So, if they want a chance, they should hold the gun.
• JQ3 says that Havi doesn’t need to worry, they fixed it so any of them can handle the gun and Havi seems visibly hurt from a previous injury, so they should relax.
• Trophistus, however, has no issue with it. He gives the gun to Havi.
• The group proceeds.
• The next place they should check is…the parlor.
• The route to the parlor is also filled with monsters. Some piranhas are swimming through the path, but also some nautilus squid monsters with tough shells.
• Havi shoots the gun
◦ The gun explodes in Havi’s hands. The bullets in the chamber erupt, and the parts of the gun fly everywhere in an explosive force.
◦ Havi is injured, and quickly fades into nothing in the explosion.
• No! NO! 
• The gun! It was a trap by the Abyss Phantom!
◦ How? How could she have been so blind…?
◦ JQ3 beats herself up over this. Of course it was too good to be true. Of course they’re stuck until they find the Silver Harpoons

• Trophistus and JQ3 manage to run, and find the parlor.
• Could the Silver Harpoons be in there?
• The two push the doors open, and there’s a box on the tables where people play cards.
• …
◦ “It is it a trap?”
• JQ3 walks over to the box, slowly, and opens it.
◦ Inside are four harpoon guns, sparkling a shining silver.
• It is…time for the final stage.
• The Abyss Phantom appears, to explain the rules of the second trial.
◦ “One of you is a fake.”
• The Abyss Phantom then vanishes, leaving JQ3 and Trophistus to their own devices.
….
• [Trophistus feels something poking behind him.]

@cg JQ3Gun
[i]"Hey."[/i]

• Trophistus responds by picking up his own harpoon gun and pointing it at her.
• JQ3 figured out the whole thing is a sham early on
• JQ3 also picked up early on that there was a saboteur among them. From the number of brooches not matching up, there were only three survivors and one of the four is the traitor.
◦ Given the hosting team has full access to everything they do, it wouldn’t be too hard to recreate any of the adventurers based on how we recognize them just out of Somni Energy,
• JQ3 confesses what happened to Havi
◦ The bullets were fine. However…
◦ The gun was rigged to explode after JQ3 messed with it
• JQ3 also claims responsibility for the room with Ehrugarr
◦ He could have easily have been the culprit, so she put him in a situation where he’d be forced to reveal himself if he was.
◦ Also, if Ehrugarr or Trophistus were the culprit, she didn’t want to deal with them working together.
• Trophistus calls JQ3 out. She’s attacked a fellow adventurer, so she’s suspicious
◦ “How am I supposed to believe you after what you did with Havi?”
◦ JQ3 retorts, Havi is fine. Ehrugarr is fine. Nobody has been hurt.
◦ “Haven’t you ever tried Somni Therapeutics before? Frankly, I’ve been on worse. Everyone is FINE.”
• Trophistus counters back.
◦ We never learned if the entity is aware they are the entity. They could have amnesia, fully unaware of their true role.
◦ JQ3’s actions in the trial indicate she’s a chaos agent, and either didn’t know it or is lying.
◦ Trophistus compliments her commitment to this bit, if she simply is lying.
• JQ3 nails Trophistus
• “You’re not Trophistus. You’re something else, wearing him as a mask!”
◦ JQ3 asks Trophistus who the queen of Graddia is, a seemingly random question.
◦ If he’s really Trophistus, he should know this. If he can’t answer, than that’s enough of an answer for her.
• Trophistus responds with a question.

“If you’re so confident with your answer, why haven’t you shot me with that gun in your hands when I have one of my own?”
• JQ3 pauses.
◦ “Why?”
• JQ3 points her gun into Trophistus’s face.
◦ “Because it’s not enough to find the culprit. I need to study you.”
◦ “You’re cornered, so you should really know when to drop this act.”
◦ “You’re not Trophistus, and frankly, I have no interest talking to that slimeball.”
◦ “No, it is you who is MUCH more. Fascinating.”
◦ “You’re the first Somni I’ve ever talked to, face to face. A scientific breakthrough, waiting to happen. Do you think I’m going to waste this opportunity?”
◦ “No. I am a scientist.”
◦ “That ri in the sky is just a part of the set. The two of us have all the time in the world, so let’s savor it.”
◦ “So, question one.”
◦ “If you-“
• JQ3 is cut off mid sentence.
◦ The entity who looks like Trophistus picks up its gun and smiles.
“Sorry. That’s the wrong answer, Miss Jairatoubis.”

...

• We cut back to Deyacron, Veveya, Liburri, and Kennewick in the dining room.
• They are just finished with the Abyss Phantom’s motivations
• The cast reacts
◦ Most of them are calm, but Liburri isn’t.
▪ “How horrible! It’s just too cruel for words!”
• The others have connected the dots. Liburri is visibly anxious, so Deyacron decides to calm her down. Simply put -
◦ “This is the real quest.”
• Nobody is in any danger. As long as they do what they need to, they’ll be fine.
• Veveya checks her inventory, and realizes they have nothing in them besides items which could be useful for the challenge. Her Magehand doesn’t have its normal capsules, just blanks.
◦ She affirms the idea this is the Quest.
• It’s hard to know what to do from here, so, Deyacron proposes their plan. They need to work as a collective unit, play along with the Abyss Phantom, and make sure all four of them escape as fast as possible.
• They need to find the Silver Harpoons, and thus need to tackle as many areas as possible.
• Veveya made a mental map of the fairgrounds during her time in the false quest, so they should tackle each area in a ring, and look towards each room quickly. If the Silver Harpoons aren’t there, move on.
◦ She also advises the group not to attack the ghosts. She points to what the Abyss Phantom said - our chances of victory would be zero percent. It’s part of the game, attacking the phantoms is against the rules.
• Deyacron asks Veveya to fire her Magehand into the air, with a blank. Veveya asks why, and Deyacron will explain later.
◦ Veveya fires the Magehand upwards. It makes a shooting noise, the blanks made to fire as loudly as possible.
• Deyacron thanks Veveya.
• She then asks Liburri to sniff the Magehand.
◦ The Magehand and Silver Harpoons are similar weapons. If they are able to track the scent of something similar to the
Magehand, then they may be able to find them more quickly.
• The closest place is the Rapquawk Farms, so they go there first.
• The group goes on their way.
• In their way are a swarm of piranha monsters, swimming through the air.
• Kennewick is ready to attack the ghosts, but Veveya manages to deescalate the situation, making sure not to say anything that wouldn’t upset them.
◦ “You need to save your magic.”
• Deyacron uses ice magic to create a field of mist from her fingertips. She advises the group to move quietly within the cloud, and not make any noises to gain the attention of the piranhas.
◦ Veveya is sad to be out of the challenge because of her blanks, but if she lays low, she’ll be okay.
• All four manage to get to the Rapquawk Farms.
◦ Liburri sniffs it.
◦ The go into the room, and there’s nothing there. No shine.
• They need to quickly move to the next area.
• The next closest place is the Sky View and its locker rooms. The route is being blocked by coral and anemone monsters, planted onto the ground and looking to bite.
◦ Liburri is freaked out by them and is cautious about going down that path.
• Deyacron is running low on mana because of her mist, so she suggests making another plan.
• Veveya then suggests Kennewick use her smoke magic to create a smokescreen the ghost monsters won’t be able to see.
◦ Kennewick says her smoke screens are too small, and it could be more efficient to fight through the coral monsters.
◦ Veveya says they should be all able to fit if the three of them crawl. Liburri should be able to guide them to the Sky View with her sense of smell. The coral monsters are mostly stationary and lack vision, and can only bend themselves forward if they sense movement.
◦ Veveya says that they’re most likely going to fight a big boss at the end of the challenge, and she wants Kennewick to look cool in the battle. The smoke screen is a cheap spell, so they need to conserve their power.
◦ Kennewick agrees to go along with it.
• The group crawls to the Sky View, making sure not to disturb any of the ghosts. Liburri leads the way in the darkness the other four are in.
• Deyacron is having a lot of fun. This is just like the P.F.K., it’s great to be able to work in a team again! Qujeon’s plan didn’t really work out, and she misses this sense of camaraderie.
• The coast is clear, and they eventually make it to the Sky View. The Sky View is closed, so they go into the locker room.
◦ Liburri sniffs it. Nothing.
• Disappointing. Next up, the card parlor.
• Kennewick asks Deyacron to pick up smoke screen duty, as they want to make sure they have enough mana in the final battle. Deyacron agrees under the condition Kennewick is it next location.
• Liburri asks if they have enough time, the ri above the surface is getting bigger.
◦ Deyacron tells Liburri not to look up, and not to worry. If they lose they lose, but if they have a chance to win, they don’t want anything clouding it.
• Deyacron puts her ice mist up, and Liburri guides the group to the card parlor.
◦ This time, they need to make their way through a field of poisonous jelly fish ghosts.
◦ They’re running faster, as Deyacron’s ice mist is larger.
• Liburri, however, doesn’t end up leading them into the card parlor. Their sense of smell has betrayed them, and they’re now at a bench with a deck of cards on it.
◦ And, they’re in an area surrounded by jellyfish, inching towards them. Their tendrils are reaching for the group.
• They need to escape, fast!
◦ Veveya knows where the card parlor is from here, so they need to run and follow her. She orders Kennewick to put up a smoke screen.
◦ Kennewick agrees. The four make a dash out, Liburri and Deyacron making sure to follow the other two.
• The four thankfully manage escape the jellyfish, and make it to a nearby wall. They take a moment to catch their breath.
◦ Veveya looks up, they’re at the Card Parlor.
◦ She makes sure to compliment Liburri for their hard work getting them here. Liburri is confused, they lead them into a trap, and could have gotten all four of them hurt. Veveya says it doesn’t matter. The three of them are a unit, and they managed to pick each other up even when the others get lost.
• The four barge into the Card Parlor. Liburri sniffs.
◦ ….
◦ !!
• She runs to a box to the front.
◦ The smell of gunpowder and metal isn’t exactly the same as the Magehand, but…
◦ She rips the top of the box off.
• Inside…are four metal harpoon guns.
• They’ve succeeded.
• The group enters the stables for Rapquawk racing.
• On a table in the center…
◦ There is a box.
• All four enter, and cheer.
• Part one of the quest, down.
• The Abyss Phantom appears, and congratulates the quartet for completing the first part of the quest.
◦ He is glad the four’s teamwork has pulled them through.
◦ However, he apologizes.
◦ This teamwork is unlikely to last. This is because
• Kennewick immediately takes their harpoon gun and shoots a bullet at the Abyss Phantom.
◦ The Abyss Phantom creates a barrier around themselves, which destroys the bullet.
• …
◦ As they were saying…
• The Abyss Phantom explains the second part of the quest. One of responsible for the rift above the surface is a false version of a real adventurer that they sneaked into their group. In order to escape, the four must find them, dispose of them, and give the
Abyss Phantom their brooch.
• They only have one chance, and one bullet. Because the Abyss Phantom is being merciful, they have placed the harpoon back in Kennewick’s gun, that shot against their life won’t count.
• The Abyss Phantom leaves.
• The group is in shock.
◦ What?
◦ After all that, this whole time, one of them is the fake?
• They don’t want to accept it. It’s illogical. Why would the fake be helping them?
• However, once further discussion occurs, that the fake isn’t necessarily an intentional saboteur and may be fully convinced they are the real deal, discussion proceeds.
• Kennewick is the first to make the argument.
◦ They suspect Liburri.
◦ There’s not a lot of evidence the four of them have access to. However, that is the behavior that sticks out the most as an attempt to sabotage the team and end the game.
• The group is quiet. They’re letting the argument play out.
• Kennewick asks Veveya if she can think of any counterarguments. She says she doesn’t believe, but has nothing.
• Kennewick asks Deyacron if she has any counterarguments. Deyacron is also skeptical, but can’t bring herself to say anything.
• The air in the room is tense, Liburri feels like the whole room is against her. She promises that the bench incident was an honest mistake, and that she is who she says she is. She’s not the fake, she’s just as real as the rest of them.
• …
• Deyacron walks over to Liburri. She turns their gaze towards her, and kneels at her level.
• They quietly and calmly ask Liburri if they are the spy. If even they are, Deyacron is not mad at them either way. Liburri can be honest. She won’t hurt them.
• Liburri, in a moment of desperation, says her answer.
◦ “….No.”
• …
• Deyacron can feel it.
◦ Liburri is telling an honest answer.
◦ She’s not lying.

• The group is stuck, they have no where else to begin.
• Deyacron, however, deduces that there is a way to start.
• The other two are confused.
• Deyacron explains.
◦ They don’t know a lot about the Abyss Phantom, but know they are a creation for this Quest.
◦ If she were the Abyss Phantom, and she were to create a copy of someone, down to the personality and smallest detail of appearance, where would they get all that information?
• Veveya pauses. The papers?
◦ Deyacron shakes her head. If only they had access to what the common public knew, it would be incredibly easy to find the fake.
◦ No. The fake was created based on host access to Zenodiver’s recordings.
• The three realize where Deyacron is going.
◦ That means, if they want to find the fake, it is less important to judge behavior, as that will only descend into witch hunting.
◦ More-so, they have to judge how the fake is different from the real one.
◦ Different?
• How would the real one be different?
◦ Deyacron doesn’t know. It would be one thing if this was a challenge with two copies of one person, but since the fake is one of them, it’s hard to know where to start.
• Kennewick says that they should look towards physical differences. Someone could have gotten a cut in an area Zenodiver never saw, and that could be a dead giveaway!
• Deyacron doesn’t seem too keen on the idea. Everyone’s bodies are likely to be different from reality in some way, due to the fact this is a dream world.
• What is different is the psyche.
• Psyche…?
• …
• Liburri pauses. She’s realized a crucial way that the fake could differ from the real one.
◦ Memories.
• Everyone goes over their testimonies again on what they did the Fortune Harvest challenge, to test if there are any contradictions.
◦ Kennewick’s create no contradictions.
◦ Veveya’s create no contradictions.
◦ Liburri’s is backed up by Deyacron.
◦ Deyacron’s is backed up Liburri.
• Fortune Harvest is a huge area. It could be easy to fake an alibi for what happened there.
• Kennewick then asks the group to name specific items in their inventory.
◦ Kennewick has hers down to the specifics.
◦ Veveya has hers down to the specifics.
◦ Liburri’s has hers down to the specifics.
◦ Deyacron’s has hers down to the specifics.
• Kennewick is frustrated, they’re getting nowhere.
• Veveya thinks. It is possible that there are memories that the fake lacks the real one should have?
• Veveya asks the group to name family members.
◦ Veveya lists the names of her three brothers, and her father. When asked about her mother, she lists the name of her deceased mother.
◦ Kennewick lists the names of people in her village as a substitute for a lack of siblings, as well as the name of her parents.
◦ Deyacron lists the names of people in her parents and fellow agents of justice in the P.F.K, including the colors of their uniforms.
◦ Liburri lists the names of people in her village.
• Another dead end! The fake has the memories of the person’s past, enough to be able to dodge questioning.
◦ Is there no hope at all?

• …

Hold on...
The fake was created by Zenodiver. So, it only has access to information it has seen.

Is there a period…
◦ Between the start of the Pilgrimage…
◦ …and now…
◦ …that could not be seen?

No.
◦ There isn’t.
◦ Except…
◦ Unless, if you’re that one person…

...
• Veveya thinks back to something Kennewick told her, several episodes ago.
◦ “Why should I tell you, it’s a secret!”

Veveya steps forward.
◦ There could be someone…with memories that differ from the real deal.
◦ She turns to Kennewick, and asks.
◦ “Kennewick, what happened to you in that first quest?”

Kennewick thinks Veveya is trying to get her.
◦ “How could I ever forget? I was eliminated by Culpex!”

• Veveya continues.
◦ “Of course I know that. You returned to the game a few days later.”
◦ “However, I never did find out what you did in those few days you were out of the game.”
◦ “Can you…please tell me? It could give us...some more information.”

• Kennewick responds.
◦ “Hmph! Why should I tell you! It’s a secret!”
◦ ….
◦ As soon as she said that, Kennewick’s demeanor shi s. She looks like even she is confused by the response that just came out of her own mouth, like she just sneezed instead of spoke.

▪ “H….huh?”
▪ “Why… did I say that?”

• Veveya continues.
◦ “Kennewick. Please. This is important.”
◦ “We need to know, for all of us, for you. We need to hear it from you.”
◦ “Where were you those during quests? Where did you go, who did you talk to? What did you do?”

• Kennewick is flustered and is trying to say something.
◦ “Stop, STOP! Slow down! Do you doubt me!? It’s easy to explain everything!”
◦ “I was at...I talked to!”
◦ “Grrrngh! GRRNH!”
◦ No words can leave Kennewick’s beak, as if something was forming in her throat preventing her words from leaving her mouth. It would be trivial for her to make up a lie, one which could not be proven.
◦ But...

• Kennewick is agitated.
◦ “Why would matter who I talked to? I spent the entire time with Pihqura’s guards and I-HHHRRGAAGH!”
◦ The words struggle out.
• Deyacron doesn’t say anything.
◦ The fake Somni have been created from footage Zenodiver captured of them.
◦ But...Pihqura said it themselves. Zenodiver cannot track people once they have been eliminated.
◦ So, if Kennewick cannot remember, or cannot say, what she did in the period between when she was out of the game and returned...

• Veveya stops.
◦ “I’m sorry Kennewick. I...won't press any further. I’ll stop.”
• Veveya places her Silver Harpoon on the table, and holds out her hand.
◦ “We only need your brooch. We...don't want anything to happen to you.”

• Kennewick refuses, and is agitated.
◦ She refuses, she insists she’s the real Kennewick.
◦ She’s not just a fake! Her memories are real! Veveya could easily be the fake, trying to deceive everyone! But she’s not falling for it!
◦ Why would she be the fake?
◦ She determined to win, and she’s destined for greatness!
◦ Everything about her has been programmed into her for the sake of one challenge? Absurd!
◦ She’s real, more real than the others here!

• Nobody in the group wants to proceed. The light above the surface is getting bigger and brighter.
◦ There are no other viable suspects, but the truth has been made painfully clear.
◦ And even if their guess is wrong, no harm will come to the other Kennewick in real life. The worst thing that could happen is losing the quest. 
◦ This is only a dream.
◦ Nobody in this world is a real, right? If you’re not human, you’re only a Somni, right? A collection of dream dust made to resemble a person.

• Kennewick begs the group not to.
◦ “No, you’re wrong! You’re all wrong!”
◦ “If I’m not Kennewick, then who am I?”
◦ The quest isn’t over yet! There could be a third part, after this! There could be a final boss Specter that they need to fight, like Veveya promised!
◦ If so, they NEED her! She’s been saving up all her mana, and she’s going to blow them to smithereens!
◦ “I can meet your expectations! Do you want me to use all my magic here, to prove it to you?”
◦ “You don’t have to do this! You don’t have to leave me by myself!”

• If that’s all the case…if this is going to end with them waking up from a bed…
◦ Why is this so difficult?
• This Kennewick…it’s definitely a fake.
◦ It’s a version of Kennewick that’s more vulnerable than she’s been with anyone.
◦ But, it’s a version of her based on what Zenodiver has seen.
◦ How much of this…is real?


• The rift’s light reaches the window of the parlor.
◦ Only sixty seconds before time runs out.
• Deyacron…looks ready to shoot.
◦ But…she lowers her gun.
▪ “I…can’t do it.”
▪ “We need to defeat her to win this challenge, right? She’s our culprit.”
▪ “But…”
▪ “She’s the culprit, but she’s done nothing wrong. I can’t bring myself to hurt her.”
▪ “There’s no justice…in this victory.

• I silence hangs in the air.
◦ ….
• And it is interrupted by a gunshot.
[BANG!]
• Kennewick pauses. A bullet has entered her chest.
◦ With not a screech and just a confused expression, she falls over.
◦ Kennewick, if this is her, fizzles away in an instant.
◦ Her brooch falls to the floor.
◦ And…it’s picked up by Liburri, the smoking gun in her hand.
• Deyacron is taken by surprise.
◦ Liburri has a solemn look on her face.
▪ “No more…”
▪ “You don’t have to carry this any more, Deyacron…”
▪ “We’re…part a team, aren’t we?”
▪ “This is something we need to carry…together.”

• The Abyss Phantom appears.
• If the three of them have found their culprit, they shall present the brooch.
◦ Liburri wordlessly puts Kennewick’s brooch in his hands.
• He congratulates the three, and prepares pods for them to escape in.
Nobody humors him back.
◦ Veveya, Deyacron, and Liburri all respond to his praise with blank stares.
• Liburri, Deyacron, and Veveya all escape as the void consumes all.
• …

——————

• Cut to a darkly lit room with twelve pods.
◦ Steam erupts from the machines as they all open.
◦ Inside is each adventurer, waking up from their slumber.
• Everyone walks out of the pods, in a daze. They are trying to recollect what had just happened and where they are.
◦ Their last memories are…the flood. They saw a man in a mask, and then Fortune Harvest was filled with water. They then remember having a strange dream. Even then, that feels like a long time ago.
◦ People struggle to remember the details of the dream. All people can muster is someone with a scythe. Was a man who cut wheat in it?
• A man with the mask enters the basement.
◦ Everyone immediately recognizes who this is, and get out their weapons.
◦ It’s him! That’s the man! That’s their guy!
◦ He’s the one who flooded Fortune Harvest! Get him!

• The man though, tells the cast to drop their weapons in a familiar, aged voice. They are in a safe place, and the trials are over.
• He unmasks, and reveals himself just to be an old man.
◦ He introduces himself.
◦ To the cast, he was the entity known as the Abyss Phantom.
◦ In real life, he is simply a powerless hermit who writes horror.
◦ Their name is Xerdegal.
• Veveya immediately recognizes Xerdegal. Not only is he a prolific horror author (she’s read all of his books), but a participant of the Third Pilgrimage. She looks excited to see him.
• Xerdegal explains where they are.
◦ They just awakened from a terrible nightmare.
◦ They are in the basement of the auction house.
• Xerdegal lets the cast know that the quest is over, and his judgments on the results of the quest are complete.
◦ Veveya asks what they mean, is the challenge already over?
• Xerdegal doesn’t elaborate and continues to talk about himself.
◦ He is the guest judge of the challenge.
◦ He is an author, compelled by the darker side of humanity.
◦ He likes horror, because it reveals the truth
◦ People reveal their true nature when put under life and death situations.
◦ This has compelled him to researching the Somni. And what he has learned there is - 
• As Xerdegal is about to drone into a monologue, the door is SWUNG open.
• Pihqura walks in, with a cup of hot chocolate.
◦ “Good morning, everyone. I hope you’re happy to see me alive and well.”
• The cast react incredibly indifferently to Pihqura’s entrance.
◦ “Hello Pihqura! It’s good to see you!"
◦ “…Hi.”
◦ “Morning.”
◦ “…”
◦ “Hey!”
• Pihqura is off-put by this.
◦ “…huh? Seriously? Well, even you guys must acknowledge this is quite an informal way to talk to someone you saw die!”
◦ [He takes a sip of hot cocoa.]
◦ “Let’s start over. This time, I’d expect at least a ‘How are you?’ or ‘You’re alive, I was so worried!’”
• Xerdegal pulls Pihqura over.
◦ The cast doesn’t have their memories back, so they don’t know what he’s talking about.
• Pihqura seems a bit disappointed, his dramatic entrance, ruined.
• Everyone in the cast is just…confused, more than anything?
◦ Memories, lost memories?
◦ What are these strange pods?
◦ Is the challenge of Fortune Harvest not the real challenge?
• Xerdegal says he will explain everything in the auction house. He’d prefer not to hold the ranking ceremony in this dusty, dark basement.
◦ There’s also hot chocolate in the auction house.

————

• The group has moved to the auction house, and is enjoying their hot chocolate.
◦ A lot of adventurers were expecting something sweet, only to be surprised by the bitter and sour taste. JQ3 dumps a whole spoonful of sugar in hers to get the drink down.

• Xerdegal decides to explain what just happened.
◦ The Fortune Harvest Quest was a false quest. It’s purpose was to monitor the cast and judge their behavior.
▪ As a result, it will not be considered for Xerdegal’s ranking this episode.
◦ Rather, the gang just went on the true quest…inside of those pods.
◦ The adventurers just experienced a collective dream induced by a new technology granted to him by the Skychosen Land’s inventors, the Dream Transmitter.
◦ The cast was separated into three groups of three, and each group shared a dream Xerdegal hooped in and out of. Zenodiver’s modules was also shared the dream, so what occurred in the dreams could be observed and reviewed.
▪ “But…that adds up to nine. Aren’t there eleven of us!?”
◦ Each group received a false adventurer, molded whole cloth from Somni by Xerdegal to imitate a specific person’s behavior and appearance.  The fakes were either copies or based on the adventurers who were not in the dreams, so everyone is A-OK.
◦ The cast’s memories of the challenge until Xerdegal is ready for the memories to return with a specific remembrance phrase.
• With all of that out of the way, the ranking ceremony begins.
• Ranking Ceremony.
• After the ranking ceremony, the results of the vote and duel will happen in Fortune Harvest’s arena.

• Xerdegal’s speech
◦ “I made this challenge as a test of character, to see how everyone would react under the pressure of an immense crisis.”

◦ “People expose their true nature when put under life and death situations, that is what I believe.”
◦ “{zenith_name}, the great hero, has been re-incarnated into this world. We must not forget our original goal - the purpose of this competition is to find {zenith_name} again.”
◦ “It does not matter how strong, or durable, or intelligent you are. If it is clear one cannot be {zenith_name} reincarnate, there is no more place for them in the competition.”
◦ “That is why I, the Abyss Phantom, did this to all of you.”
◦ “What mattered wasn’t combat. What mattered wasn’t luck. What mattered was behavior, and how you reacted to this imaginary conflict.”

• Without further ado, Xerdegal reveals the results of the trials.
• Kennewick. Ozapold. Yunyere. Uelgwold.
◦ The chosen impostor was Kennewick.
◦ The real impostor was Yunyere.
◦ They failed.
• JQ3, Trophistus, Havi, Veveya.
◦ The chosen impostor was JQ3.
▪ “….”
◦ The real impostor was Trophistus.
◦ They failed.
• Deyacron, Ehrugarr, Liburri, Kennewick.
◦ The chosen impostor was Kennewick.
◦ The real impostor was Kennewick.
◦ They passed.

• Xerdegal says the remembrance phrase. Everyone’s memories return.

• Everyone’s reactions are mixed.
• Deyacron, Liburri, and Veveya are solemn. They’re glad they got the result right, and appear to be the only successful team. 
◦ At the very least, Veveya asks the team not to think about the bittersweet final result, but the coordination that allowed them to win in the first place. It took a lot of effort, and this is a moment to be proud of their accomplishments.
• Havi and Ehrugarr are surprised. JQ3 was the choice?
◦ Havi makes sure to let Ehrugarr know that the gun he handed them blew up shortly afterwards, and JQ3 was the only human to make the choice.
◦ Havi is about to grill Ehrugarr, but JQ3 owns the mistake. JQ3 gives a half apology to Havi over giving a gun that broke after their upgrades, and that it was an honest mistake.
◦ Havi asks why the choice ended up being JQ3, if she was the only human le with Trophistus. She says that Somni Trophistus got the better of her and took her brooch.
• Trophistus walks over to JQ3’s team, and asks them if they’re okay. They’re fine, they were just convinced it Trophistus with them.
◦ Ehrugarr looks visibly disappointed with themselves for not being able to sniff out the fake Trophistus. This is a conformation to him that he really doesn’t know as much as he thinks he does. They hope they can fight their way out of the bottom, and they’re not confident they’re safe due to their early death in the trial.
◦ Havi is just fully ready to accept elimination this episode. “Whatever, I had a good run.”
• The most turbulent team is definitely Ozapold, Kennewick, and Uelgwold. The three of them don’t want to talk to each other.
◦ Kennewick is in their corner, seething over what Ozapold did to them.
◦ Ozapold has no comments. This was their time to shine as a leader, and they dropped the ball incredibly hard.
◦ Uelgwold just seems disinterested in the situation. Disappointed in themselves, but they shrug it off.
• And then we have Yunyere, in their corner, confused at why everyone is yelling at each other.
◦ “I had a pleasant dream! I got to see my castle again, and I got to eat a lot of cherry pie! Did that happen to anyone else?”


——————

• Ranking
◦ With the reveal of who the fakes are, Xerdegal decides to start the ranking with the two contestants who were not in the dream - Yunyere and Trophistus.
▪ They were both spared from the dream due to their high scores in the first, false challenge - the Token Collection. Instead of meeting the Abyss Phantom, they were put into cyro-sleep until the quest was over.
▪ This means neither of them are in the conversation for the quest’s ranking, as their fakes were in the quest instead of them.
▪ Not getting to participate is considered their prize.
▪ (also winckary)
◦ Xerdegal then restates how the challenge was judged - not just by crossing the finish line, but by behavior which indicate a return of {zenith_name}.
◦ Everyone on the Fake Kennewick team is safe - Deyacron, Veveya, and Liburri. All of them made it to the end and successfully deduced Kennewick was the fake.
◦ Xerdegal decides the winner of the challenge is easily Deyacron, due to how well she handled her team and how efficiently she figured out the false target.
▪ Xerdegal makes a comment to Deyacron - she’s easily the adventurer he sees the most of {zenith_name} in.
◦ Veveya gets second, and Liburri gets third.
◦ This leaves Kennewick, Ozapold, Uelgwold, Havi, Veveya, and JQ3, who all failed their trials.
◦ Right away, Xerdegal excuses Ehrugarr, and says he’s safe.
▪ This was not an endurance challenge, and the monsters in this challenge were intentionally overturned and impossible to defeat. They were repeatedly warned not to deal with Specters, and Ehrugarr was someone who was just kind of in the wrong place at the wrong time. He would be in trouble if more teams succeeded in the trial, but since he went out of his way to protect the other three members in his defeat, he’s safe.
◦ Havi is also…safe.
Xerdegal is more hesitant on this one. While Havi could have easily figured out that the gun was a trap, they were ultimately not yet aware that the Abyss Phantom on the team, something to be discovered once the Silver Harpoons were found. Their result was largely out of their control this episode, and while they didn’t perform in a way Xerdegal would have liked, they’re ultimately safe.

◦ This leaves Ozapold, JQ3, Uelgwold, Kennewick. Xerdegal isn’t happy with any of them, and he’d feel okay with putting any of them in a duel.
▪ All four are here because they were present for the decision to find the fake and contributed to their team making the wrong choice.
◦ Each of their performances are worthy of scorn for their own reasons.
▪ Uelgwold didn’t listen to either of their teammates, and failed to deescalate conflict between the two other members. They lacked drive this challenge, and could have easily been the member who argued for the true result.
▪ Ozapold didn’t deescalate their arguments with Kennewick, and felt mostly concerned with their leadership and using incredibly time inefficient strategies to find the Silver Harpoons. They caved to emotion under pressure, and didn’t even think to consider the true result of Yunyere being the fake. He calls Ozapold’s biases and stubbornness into question.
▪ Kennewick was someone Xerdegal anticipated to step up to the plate, but was disappointed by. Her plans would have repeatedly put the members of her team in danger, and she didn’t have the strength or rhetoric to make her case and get the target off of her when it was Yunyere. She tries to get in that Yunyere was an accident, but Xerdegal responds that he doesn’t consider Kennewick someone who is taking the game seriously or generally fit for any leadership position.
▪ JQ3. Xerdegal is most disappointed by JQ3, since she was one step ahead of the challenge and figured out the twist of the fake incredibly early. By the end, she also figured out Trophistus was the fake by process of elimination. She could be potentially safe if she presented Trophistus’s brooch. However, not only was her path to this truth incredibly destructive, Xerdegal bringing up the gun she rigged to explode, she didn’t take out Trophistus when she had him cornered in favor of pushing for her own agenda of Somni research. Victory was in her fingers, and she let it slip.
◦ Xerdegal pauses. They’ve reached their decision.
▪ This person had their lows, but they did things in their challenge to make up for it. Definitely far from perfect, but Xerdegal sees the most potential in this person to be {zenith_name} in the future.


▪ This person is…
▪ …Ozapold.
◦ Xerdegal continues.
▪ It is true that Ozapold went out of their way to save Yunyere, the person that was the fake. If he did, then he would be enabling the survival of a saboteur in the group, right?
▪ However, Ozapold went for it, even when the odds were stacked against him. Xerdegal considers that worthy of recognition, even if that Yunyere ended up being the fake and Ozapold was ultimately unsuccessful.
▪ He isn’t entirely happy with Ozapold, and if more people performed well, he’d be in trouble. But…he gives him the pass this time.
◦ The Bottom 3 is finalized - Kennewick, Uelgwold, and JQ3.
◦ Kennewick is FUMING.
▪ She tried her honest best this challenge in her first solo challenge back, and she’s in the bottom again!
▪ The person who humiliated her, the person who turned against her, and called her a saboteur because of their inability to see the bigger picture!
▪ The person who shot a bullet through her chest, and made the team’s losing choice for her!
▪ Them! SAFE!
▪ No matter how much she tries, nobody takes her seriously!
◦ Ozapold is quiet, and solemn.
▪ Their expression doesn’t change to one of relief, even though they are now safe.
◦ Kennewick asks Xerdegal to reconsider.
▪ Xerdegal does not budge. He is firm with his decision. Kennewick had the chance to get the culprit right, and failed. Her performance in the challenge indicated no sense that she is {zenith_name}’s reincarnation.
▪ Veveya, Deyacron, and Liburri share a concerned look.

• Voting phase begins.

• Havi is incredibly annoyed with Kennewick right now.
◦ “Do you even hear yourself?”
◦ No matter how many times Kennewick gets back up, she’s always beaten back into the ground. At this point, it’s kind of humiliating. It’s her time to go, so she should accept her elimination with grace.
◦ Anything else would be avoiding sunk cost fallacy.
• Kennewick tells Havi to be quiet.
◦ She doesn’t back down! She’s going to win this game!
◦ She just needs to change the results so she doesn’t go home this episode!
• Havi is unaffected.
◦ “No. It is too late for that.”
◦ “You’ve already been given a second chance, and you’ve blown it spectacularly.”
◦ Everyone here thinks they’re not going to win, Kennewick isn’t special.
◦ Havi has accepted they aren’t special, and so should everyone else.
◦ Other contestants have been eliminated for less. Kennewick has messed up repeatedly, and nobody should have to take her seriously anymore.
◦
• Kennewick wants to retaliate, but her voice cracks as she’s about to speak.
• She wants to be angry, but that anger is turning into sadness.
• She can’t think to respond to Havi, she turns to Xerdegal.

@icon Kennewick.Crying
◦ “Please…y-you can’t….!”
◦ “Y-you can’t! You can’t s-send me b-back again!”
◦ “Give me another chance…p-please…”

• Xerdegal does not waver.
• Havi sneers.
◦ “Pathetic. Is this what was behind your persona of a big bad conquerer?”
◦ “{zenith_name} put you in this game to teach you a lesson in humility. That’s the only way I can justify it.”
• Havi is interrupted.
◦ Deyacron: “Havi., that’s enough!”
◦ JQ3: “Alright, cut it out. We get it! You’ve made your point! Let’s just shut up and get this vote over with already!”
• This gets Havi to be quiet.
◦ “Fine. I’ll stop.”
• Havi stops, and an awkward silence is in the air.
• That silence is soon broken by everyone going into their own groups, to discuss the safe vote. JQ3, Uelgwold, or Kennewick.
◦ Nobody wants to talk about the vote openly.
◦ Confessional from JQ3. The way things turned out, she feels like Uelgwold is going to fight Kennewick. She’s confident Uelgwold is safe, but she’s not happy about the way things had to happen.
◦ Veveya is quiet. She’s sympathetic to Kennewick, but doesn’t know what to say with the writing on the wall.
• Soon, nobody is paying Kennewick any mind, as the chatter turns to who to use the save vote on.
• But Kennewick screeches out in the middle.
◦ “Wait…please wait!”
◦ “There’s something…something you're forgetting!!”
• Attention to turns to Kennewick.

@icon Kennewick.Crying
• Kennewick begins to talk, desperate and sorrowful.
◦ “All of you….are right!”
◦ “When you say Kennewick is weak…all of you are right!”
◦ “When you say Kennewick is stupid…all of you are right!”
◦ “When all of you say Kennewick is a failure…”
◦ “That’s right, because that’s what I am!”
◦ “I’m useless! Completely incapable of doing anything right!”
◦ “A failure, someone who has been a failure their whole life! A failure that doesn’t deserve to stand with the rest of you!”
◦ “I’m lower than the lowest of the low! I’m lower than JQ3, lower than Uelgwold, lower than even you, Havi!”
◦ “I’m lower than the tiniest, most PATHETIC flea on this whole continent!”
◦ “You all think Culpex was wrong? You think it was wrong for Culpex to give me this chance, instead of someone else? 
◦ “Well, that’s RIGHT! They were a fool! A complete dumb-ass! A complete dumb-ass that trusted me with this second chance!”
◦ “I’m not a chosen warlock! I’m some nobody from the dredges of Breizan! And that’s where I belong, and deserve to spend the rest of my life!”
◦ “Fate made a mistake! Fate made a mistake choosing me, because I don’t and never belonged here!”
◦ “If you think there’s a chance I’m {zenith_name}, you are either blind or stupid!”
◦ ….


• Kennewick balls their fist.
◦ “And that’s….” 
◦ “That’s…”
◦ “That’s….”
◦ “That’s!”
◦ “That’s that’s!”
• …?
◦ Something’s happening.
• Kennewick’s mood is shi ing, suddenly.
◦ There are tears rolling from her eyes, but the sadness is all gone.
◦ A burst of confidence shows in its place, a confident smirk waxing upwards under tearful eyes.

Kennewick turns her head upwards, proud, and makes her declaration.
@icon Kennewick.Gloat
◦ “THAT’S EXACTLY WHY I DESERVE YOUR VOTE, YOU FOOLS!”
• The cast is confused. But a lot of them are intrigued.
• Kennewick further explains.
◦ Kennewick points dramatically at Uelgwold, and asks them if they’re confident they can beat Kennewick in a duel.
▪ Uelgwold gives a confident High Aquolion grunt indicating a yes.
◦ Kennewick then points at JQ3, asking them if they’d win.
▪ JQ3 says yes. Kennewick’s aiming is poor, and JQ3 can outrun them.
◦ Kennewick claps. There you have it, Kennewick has no winning match-ups!
▪ “Me, against either of them? A forgone conclusion! History, HISTORY! We all say the travesty of the first duel! Use the vote on them, and there won’t be any Kennewick le !”
▪ “Do you want to know why? Because of how weak Kennewick is, she represents no threat to anyone!”
▪ “If you are insistent on sending me home this episode, then you just wasted this opportunity to get rid of someone more threatening!”
▪ “You may never ever have this chance again!”

◦ The room is silent.
▪ “Oh, am I thinking too small?”
▪ “Because the scope of this is much bigger than just these results!”
◦ “You all say I’m not {zenith_name}? You all say I’m unqualified! OF COURSE!”
◦ “I never was! Why would I want to be {zenith_name}!”
◦ “Of course I’m not {zenith_name}! I’m something FAR WORSE!”
◦ Kennewick then points to the crowd.
◦ “{zenith_name}! YOU! Are you watching this travesty? Do you consider my PATHETIC shrills to be music to your ears?”
◦ “If this message reaches you, there shall be less obstacle for people to recognize your grace if you keep me in!”
◦ “It’s not enough to be biggest, best hero ever! If you’re not smart about it, you could end up like Qujeon! Everyone’s golden boy, sent home tragically by fate! Oh, poor poor sweet Qujeon!”
◦ “Do you want your heroics recognized, do you want a villain that can you can rub your superiority into? OR! Do you want to be beaten by some other joe, who considers themselves the TRUE hero of this story!”
◦ “Because I believe in you. You’re the true hero of this story, {zenith_name}!”
◦ “I will continue to fight in this pilgrimage! And I will fight as hard as I can, just to make sure you fail right at the end!”
◦ “I await our confrontation! ZENIIIIIITH!”

• …
• The cast talk amongst themselves. They don’t know what to make of Kennewick’s speech.
• Veveya, Deyacron, and Liburri talk amongst each other.
◦ Deyacron is confused by what Kennewick meant.
◦ Veveya, though, thinks she knows.
◦ To her interpretation, Kennewick is saying she deserves to be saved because she’s an easy opponent to be sacrificed at a later point in the game.
• Havi and Yunyere are talking amongst each other as well.
◦ Havi vents to Yunyere about Kennewick’s argument to be the save vote for being absolutely illogical. To be “Zenith” isn’t something you can win, you can’t turn the ocean a completely different color just by working hard. Zenith is, objectively, one of the eleven remaining people. It is a fact that was true at the start of the game and remains true at the end.
◦ Kennewick isn’t {zenith_name}. The game doesn’t need her anymore, because the person who will become {zenith_name} is just as likely to appear with or without her presence. JQ3 and Uelgwold may have both done some truly unheroic stuff this episode, but even they have a greater chance of winning than her.
◦ Yunyere is just. Nodding along.
◦ …
◦ Still though. It doesn’t matter what they think. It matters what everyone else thinks. Will this cast be stupid enough to take the bait?

• The cast from this point leaves the Auction House, and splits up around Fortune Harvest to breathe.
——————
• Trophistus meets with JQ3
◦ JQ3 is still on edge because of Somni-Trophistus
• Trophistus takes out a cardboard pastry box
◦ “I got this earlier today.”
◦ He hands the box to JQ3.
◦ “Here. To help ease your nerves.”
• JQ3 is pleasantly surprised. She thanks Trophistus
◦ “Oh! Uh, thank you!”
◦ JQ3 takes the box.
• Trophistus leaves.
◦ “If you excuse me….”
• JQ3 opens the box.
◦ “Ease my nerves, huh? Let’s see what he got me!”
◦ JQ3 slowly pries open the box.
◦ “Trophistus knows my tastes, right? It could be donuts, it could macaroons…”
◦ “Could be day old bread….but it also could be…”
◦ “….”
◦ “……!?”
◦ A look of concern enters JQ3’s face.
◦ Inside the pastry box…are two Megalixirs.
▪ (These are endgame level potions, the fact Trophistus was able to afford them this early is kind of insane.)
▪ “Wh…”
▪ “What the hell?”
• JQ3’s reaction to the gi is…panicky.
◦ “What the HELL? No. No! You’re shitting me, RIGHT?”
————————
• Cut to JQ3. She’s chomping down on an economy bag of hard candy
◦ She’s trying to think of a plan to survive this vote, and nothing is working
• Uelgwold arrives to the scene
◦ JQ3 reveals her state of mind to Uelgwold - she’s stressed as hell and she’s figured out where the vote is going

Uelgwold suggests to work out something with the Platoon and get the vote on her or one of them
◦ JQ3 makes a stressed assertion that that won’t work
▪ “This is a game where you gotta take whatever advantage you can and run with it. Spin the board around and think about how everyone else’s thinking this vote.”
▪ “Sure, I got the Platoon…but what about you?”
▪ “Between that whelp, a big-brained bombshell like me, and someone as hard to read as you, the choice on who’s the least dangerous is…pretty clear.”
◦ JQ3 gets up. Her grip on the bag tightens.
▪ “I see what she has done! How smart! How clever! How devilish! Under any other circumstances, I’d applaud her!”
◦ Uelgwold thinks. Because the Platoon doesn’t want to part with JQ3, he is confident they’d be able to switch the vote from Kennewick to JQ3 if they convince the Platoon hard enough. After all, keeping JQ3 in is should be important than getting Uelgwold out.
◦ JQ3 deflates. She takes out the box, reveals to Uelgwold Trophistus’s gi .
▪ “He…gave this to me. Two mega-elixirs!”
▪ “Damn it, is he made out of money? Do you know how hard these are to come by! I know EXACTLY what you’re doing!”
▪ “Why would you give this to me…if you intend for me to win the save vote?”
▪ “Why would you give this to me…if you want me to fight such a self-admittedly WEAK opponent!”
▪ “That GODDAMN [High Aquolion Profanity]”
▪ “No, there’s only one outcome…only one outcome…”
▪ “AAARGH!”
◦ She sniffed out what Trophistus is doing and sees right through this “gi ” - he’s going to save Kennewick and get the others to vote along with him to force JQ3 vs Uelgwold
▪ Trophistus wants JQ3 to survive and beat Uelgwold. Does he know about the alliance?
▪ JQ3 sees this as Trophistus having ambitions and an agenda greater than the Platoon, that they’re stepping stones.
▪ “If he gets what he wants this episode, this alliance is toast!”
◦ Uelgwold asks if JQ3 going to use the potions, as that is one way she can guarantee her safety this round no matter what happens.
▪ “What? NO! I refuse!”
▪ “How would that be fair to you? I have these two potions, and you don’t!”
▪ “You’re a tough opponent, and I refuse to give you anything LESS than a fight using my own two hands!”
▪ “And…if I were to be saved by these potions…”
▪ “I’d be in a debt! That bastard would out me into his debt, he’d hold it over my head for the rest of the game, that I’d be taking an airship home if it wasn’t for his “generosity”!
▪ “It doesn’t matter if I survive this duel! This debt…it will just mean a later defeat!”
◦ JQ3 munches on the candies, but faster.
▪ “But…but…”
▪ “Now that he’s given it to me, what would happen if my health falls to the red and I DIDN’T use one?!”
▪ “He’d get suspicious! He’d get SUPER SUSPICIOUS!”
◦ She doesn’t know a way out of this, so she’s trying to reach maximum brainpower to figure out how to save the Aquolion Alliance
▪ “Don’t worry! I’m still only operating on, what 70% brain power? There’s still time! [chomp] I can think of something that’ll get both of us out of this!”
▪ “That old bastard! I’d rather be dealing version of him that was straight up trying to kill us!”
▪ “Yunyere? Ozapold? They’re safe because of their virtuous actions? Well, that’s an awfully nice thing to say from your high horse! How were they supposed to know that Uelgwold or Havi weren’t the impostor?”
▪ “Does he think I’m NOT aware of what he just did? Does he think I’m STUPID? I’m Jairatoubis Quijano the Third! I-“
▪ “I….”
• Uelgwold puts his hand on JQ3’s shoulder. She slows down.
◦ JQ3 apologizes for snapping at Uelgwold, the stress is getting ot her.
◦ The vote is discussed, and how weird this one it is. It is unlike any that has happened so far.

◦ “Get out the fake, and you’re safe, right?” JQ3 overlooked the specific of the challenge, but she laments that, if she were a millisecond faster, could she been deemed safe? Is she only in this situation because she wasn’t victorious?
▪ “I knew it was Trophistus. I successfully figured out he was the fake and still…”
◦ JQ3’s mind has been running a lot more than it’s supposed to.
▪ With her place in the game on the line, everything she hasn’t yet done in the game is running through her mind.
▪ She still needs to get stronger, and ensure a plan which will get Uelgwold into the Final Gauntlet.
▪ She still needs to force Ozapold’s hand and get him and herself to officially cut ties with Trophistus this new Platore Platoon.
▪ She still needs to make that scientific breakthrough that will improve the world, while she’s still allowed to stay in the Skychosen Lands, that will justify why she of all people was chosen.

• Cut away from the scene.
• Ehrugarr submits their vote.
◦ They don’t feel great about it, because they feel they’re exploiting someone’s weakness as a means for an easier time down the road. But, if it means he’ll be closer to the end if what they’re saying is true, he’ll go with it.
• Trophistus submits his vote.
◦ “…Well played, Miss Celda. We’ll see how your little plan plays out.”
• Veveya submits her vote.
◦ “Kennewick…my vote isn’t a result of believing what you said being true. I just want to give you the floor to heal.”
• Yunyere submits his vote.
◦ He didn’t use the Depth Plunge on Veveya because Trophistus is a bigger target and isn’t on the elimination ranking.
◦ He knows exactly who to vote for.
▪ “Here goes nothing! If this works, I’ll never have to worry about fighting that barrier person ever again!”
• Votes are over. Everyone has to go to the chapel for the duel.
◦ JQ3: “…Don’t worry, Uelgwold. Everything’s gonna be…fine.”
◦ JQ3: “If it really was that bastard’s plan to secretly kick you out of the game, my next invention’s gonna be a machine that’ll rip his dick off!”
◦ This gives Uelgwold some solace.
• The votes come out.
• This is easily the most polarized vote session yet, but, Kennewick ends up pulling through.
• The duel will be JQ3 vs Uelgwold.
◦ Havi: “You’re fucking joking.”
• The Bottom 2 prepare for their duel.
◦ Uelgwold:  ♒ ♏ ■  ⧫ ♒ ♏ ⍓  ⧫ ❒ ⍓  ⧫ □  ◻● ♋ ⍓  ⍓ □ ◆ ❒  ♎ ♏ ♋ ⧫ ♒  ♒ ⍓ ❍ ■  ♋ ● ●  ⍓ □ ◆  ♍ ♋ ■  ♎ □  ♓ ⬧  ♎ ♋ ■ ♍ ♏ ♋ ● □ ■ ♑ ✏ ☸  (When they try to play your death hymn, all you can do is dance along!)

• JQ3 vs Uelgwold

• Just as the duel starts, JQ3 takes a step forwards
◦ The ground her foot makes a light noise…
◦ And Uelgwold lets out a howl.
• He puts his hand out, to stop JQ3

• [JQ3 VS UELGWOLD] 
◦
(empty but will write this once JQ3’s drawing powers are more defined, currently reworking)
• JQ3 is dealt a final blow
◦ The Reviver Ring activates
• JQ3 is alive! At only 1 HP.
• She charges her final attack.
• JQ3 is eliminated
——————
• A grand ringing is heard throughout the festival.
• The fourth bell…has chosen it’s sacrifice.
• The cast reflects on JQ3 now that she’s been eliminated

◦ Ozapold: “Damn it, Xerdegal? What were you thinking with that ranking! It should have been me down there, not her! I let Yunyere die, and now JQ3? And if it was, perhaps I could have…”
◦ Trophistus: “An item embargo…you must have known ahead of time what I got for JQ3, then. Well played, Uelgwold.” 

• JQ3 and Uelgwold final convo 
• JQ3 gives her special chocolate bar to Uelgwold
◦ “It’s a special kind of chocolate imported from Platore. It tastes like nothing else in this world!”
◦ “I was saving this for an emergency, like when my back was really against the wall. But, you could probably use this more than me…just in case they make your really have to use that noggin.”
• JQ3 exit line -
◦ “See you all again, when there’s a Pilgrimage to find something else.”

——————————————
• JQ3 and Pihqura exit
◦ Pihqura asks if there’s anything le she has to say
◦ JQ3 admits she kind of knew that she didn’t have it in her to win down the line, but she just hoped it would be like, what, four episodes later?
◦ She’s disappointed it’s this early, she wants to stay in the Skychosen Lands because she’s still interested Somni research for her inventions
◦ Pihqura promises to give her a ticket back to the Skychosen Lands with her name on it.
—————————————
• Uelgwold talks to Havi, Havi being the person JQ3 confided most in besides Ozapold.
Havi lies to Uelgwold’s face about something
◦ Uelgwold doesn't trust it
————————————————
• Havi confessional
◦ Havi believes their position in the game is because they have been chosen for a higher purpose


————————————————
• Deyacron is by herself. She’s reflecting on the results of the quest.
◦ She wants to be a hero of justice, and she wants to be exactly like {zenith_name}. This game is the way to do it, to prove she’s just like them.
◦ And, she won the challenge. She’s like {zenith_name}, right?
◦ Her mind cannot stop thinking about Somni-Kennewick, however. She was an innocent, and the successful route of this game required them to shoot her down.
◦ If she continues to play the game, is Deyacron currently following the path of justice?
• Liburri enters.
• Deyacron and Liburri talk about what should be done going forward.
◦ Their “alliance” is most likely going to have to be secret. Liburri vocalizes being scared that the two of them will be targeted over their alliance. Deyacron agrees to this boundary, acknowledging Liburri still has a lot of room to get used to the world outside her cave.
• Liburri confessional.
◦ Liburri is concerned she may be growing attached to the world on the surface. Her reason for fighting is to make life better for her village, but she if she stays in too long, will she be able to go back?
◦ Can she still accept help from Deyacron, and still live have an un-poisoned mind?
————————————————
• Xerdegal final scene
• He’s at the device, with Pihqura.
• The two of them are talking.
◦ Xerdegal doesn’t appear to be happy with the duel’s result. He feels that Kennewick shouldn't have survived the safe vote, and should have proven herself in the duel. To throw their fellow contestants under the bus for their own agenda is unlike {zenith_name}. He isn’t mad that Kennewick survived, he would have been okay with anyone in the Bottom 3 going. More-so, he’s disappointed in the cast for choosing to save her for what he perceives are selfish strategic reasons.
◦ Pihqura defends her, or at least her actions. To flip the chessboard towards her perspective, there’s not a lot she could have done besides roll over and accept her defeat. This is a game where you need to have some degree of self preservation to survive, and people would prefer not to end up like Qujeon.
◦ Also, he reminds Xerdegal that he is trying not to become too biased with the cast, so there’s only so much he can give his opinion towards regarding the results of things like this.
• Xerdegal pushes some buttons. He reverts the dream, and all the Somni that survived, back into Somni energy
• It is explained that Somni will eventually deteriorate like all life, so it’s better to return the Somni to energy to use their life more efficiently
• Xerdegal’s final line of the episode.
◦ “A dream…can never be the same as reality.”
◦ “Something created in a dream…can never be human.”

—————————————————
• Uelgwold is all alone.
◦ After that scene with Havi, we are reminded of where they are. They’re all alone, and the person they were going to make it to the end with is now gone.


◦ If he sticks with Havi, the only path is elimination
◦ He’s going to need an entirely new plan if she wants to survive, and its not gonna be with Havi.
• Kennewick enters the scene
◦ Kennewick boats about surviving
▪ “How does it feel to be utterly defeated, bested in this game of wits?”
◦ Uelgwold approaches Kennewick and says something to them

———————————————————
• Veveya examines their notes on Trophistus, alongside a repository of Magic Identifier books they got from a library
◦ She has a newspaper featuring the cast, from when the cast was first revealed and first departed. She picked it up at the library.
• They begin examining the photos in depth.
———————————————————
• Ehrugarr reflection
◦ He likes Trophistus because he likes having a rival
◦ He’s a lot more proactive in the game because of him
◦ He feels some sense of fulfillment in the game because of the mental battles they have
———————————————————
• Final Trophistus scene this episode
• Trophistus admits that he does not like Pihqura
◦ He considers him horrible as a leader, someone who did nothing to help the people of Graddia
◦ He considers Graddia to be a “dying husk, clinging to life.”
◦ He considers him someone who did nothing with the power of {zenith_name}, and could not have truly been {zenith_name}
• Trophistus’s thoughts on {zenith_name}
◦ “{zenith_name} is a tool for those to gain power, it, or they can be whatever you want it to mean.”
◦ Trophistus, thus, declares himself to be {zenith_name} if that is what he must be
———————————————————
Veveya finishes their notes on Trophistus’s picture.
• They had to use a lot of obscure references to put the puzzle together.
• She’s left with a code, a code that applies to Trophistus’s body. She opens up one of her Library books, to see what the code means.
• …
• The code…
• The code only exists in people who have no magical powers to speak of.
• ?
• Veveya is…shocked. No, that’s wrong. Of course Trophistus has powers.
• She double checks her evidence.
• Triple checks it.
• …
• Oh…no.
• The new code she has, it’s…
• It’s the exact same as hers, when she asks someone to try it.
• It’s telling the truth.
• No matter how she looks at it, there’s no way Trophistus can have magic.
• She reflects on what that means if this is true.
◦ Is this really the truth?
◦ How long has he refused to tell anyone?
◦ And…what is he planning, if that’s the case.
——————
• Zenodiver boots down.
It’s just you and Metapihqura now.
• “Data collected.”
• “Hey, can I talk to you?”
• Metapihqura is conflicted this episode
◦ He was created by Xerdegal
◦ Even though his memories are Pihqura’s, he doesn’t consider Pihqura’s parents to be his own. When he sees the face of
Pihqura’s mom, he feels nothing. His creator is Xerdegal.
• Moreover, he’s thinking about the Somni created in Episode 5
◦ “If Xerdegal is his dad, wouldn’t that make those guys my siblings?”
◦ “Could I have turned out like that…if I didn’t know what my arrangement was, and was fully convinced I was the real Pihqura?”
◦ “A Somni like that could have been me if I had a bad hair day.”
