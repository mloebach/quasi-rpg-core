Episode 4 (Into the Sunstone Castle)					
Sidequest Day 1					
@icon Pihqura
Deyacron receives the prize for winning the last challenge - the Depth Plunge. If she uses it, someone of her choice will sink 3 spots in the ranking.					
Ozapold is finally thinking of expanding the Platore Platoon, specifically to include Viveph, Trophistus, and Winckary. Meetings for the Platore Platoon are moved to the Gear Room of the Silver Dragon upon Havigrel’s request					
Viveph is still shaken by the letter, but decides not to tell anyone due to the implicit threat in it. They decide writing an apology letter to Yunyere is the best course of action. 					
Cut to a scene where Liburri explains her motives to Unkerite. She wants to win so she can support her community in the cave, but if she does not win, she does not think she’ll leave her cave again. She is fine with that.					
Yunyere bounces back to his happy cheerful mode, but you can see in his confessionals he has not gotten over Archie’s elimination and wants both Viveph and Trophistus OUT. They figured out Trophistus was behind the last challenge, and this has earned him a significant enemy. A sense of foreboding is elicited regarding how he interacts with Meila and Deyacron in Archie’s absence.					
Night time arrives on Day 1. People are chilling, when an airship arrives on the scene. Out pops…..Kennewick. Surprise! She is back and ready to compete!					
The cast is flabbergasted and somewhat confused. Jairos explains that, after discussing it with Culpex, the first episode is having its duel nullified due to the foul play involved in Kennewick’s low placement. Even if it was fired accidentally, the Neptune Pearlshot that shot Kennewick was still an illegal weapon Culpex should not have used. Regamirr’s episode will now be considered the “true” first episode, and Culpex has hence decided to disqualify himself as a participant to focus their efforts on the investigation.					
Nobody is really thrilled Kennewick is back...but nobody is that upset either.					
Quird asks Viveph to observe Kennewick’s magic prowess. He notes no major changes in his complexion.					
Sidequest Day 2					
The Quest is announced and explained ahead of time.					
It's a triathlon where two teams of six have to carry a torch all the way across the Sun Stone Castle. Jairos and Unkerite explain using a map - they start from the underground caverns, to the Monster Chambers, to the castle's labyrinth, to the mountain trail on the way up, to the final area. It’s a challenge that will test labyrinth navigation, climbing, monster riding, combat, and various other skills. The team who reaches the beacon with their torch and lights it wins. (Currently, what the challenge entails is very flexible.)					
The flame can go out, but can be relit using special matches. It is in the participant’s best interest to keep it burning.					
The Sun Stone Quest is hyped up as the most difficult and dangerous quest so far, so they will have the rest of the day to decide on teams. Their selections lock the morning of the challenge.					
Kennewick will not be participating. She will not be able to cast a vote this episode either.					
Groups form, largely based on pre-existing alliances.					
Blue Team and their order is Ozapold, Viveph, Winckary, Quird, Trophistus, and Sunstriker.					
Red Team and their order is Meila, Yunyere, Deyacron, Ehrugarr, Liburri, and Havigrel.					
We spend more time detailing the formation of Red Team than Blue Team.					
Havigrel decides to join Red Team since “they’re losing faith in the Platore Platoon and want to be on the winning team.” Ehrugarr’s history as a Rapwak Farmer makes him ideal for a challenge with a segment where you ride Rapwaks, so he is quickly swooped up by Red Team. Liburri is also chosen, since Meila sees her as a potential replacement for Archie.					
Sunstriker detests the idea of working with Meila, so Trophistus is able to recruit them for Blue Team.					
Winckary and Kennewick spend the day being prank rivals. Havigrel, looking on from a distance, sees Kennewick’s magic practices and notices a lot of the mistakes she is making are rookie mistakes. Mistakes Havigrel knows and can fix. They recognize that this power would be really potent in more competent hands, but it balances out since “Kennewick is a moron”.					
Culpex is on a Wildboar, chasing down a lead. The ride animal has currently taken him somewhere deep, way ahead of where the Pilgrimage is. He is lead into the Desert Jungle, a place infested with high level monsters.					
Based on Culpex’s intuition, they feel the Desert Jungle is where their mystery culprit would go next.					
Culpex laments that they can’t contact Regamirr right now, he could really use some pointers on where to go.					
Culpex saddles the Wildboar, but a loud noise from the jungle causes it to run away. There is clearly something in there it senses that it does not like. Culpex no longer has a ride...so he is gonna have to call Jairos or Regamirr to pick him up once the mission is done.					
They go deeper in the jungle, making note to not alert any high level monsters					
In the jungle...they find...a caped figure. They’re wearing a mask.					
Is this their person? Culpex tries to sneak up behind them and fire a freezing arrow...but they’re spotted.					
They turn to Culpex, and push him backwards with a gust of wind.					
Culpex slams into a tree. The masked figure delivers a cryptic message: “This cycle is destined to end...and we’re going to do it with our own hands.” Culpex asks if they're the one that framed him. They evade the question, but respond that it won’t matter. Culpex, the Zenith Guild, this whole process of Pilgrimages, everything would be better if they all disappeared.					
The masked figure pulls out a three sided axe, and charges at Culpex.					
Culpex pulls out the Snow Cloak, and almost dodges. The axe hits, and cuts through him like butter. He is badly hurt.					
This is not a fight he can win, even with all his pimped out stolen relics. Culpex realizes he needs to book it, NOW.					
Desperate, Culpex tries to sic a high level monster on them, but the Masked Figure just calls upon a lightning spell to fry it.					
In a last ditch effort, Culpex saddles onto a bird monster, and tries to fly away. He pulls out a Smoke Camera (think Wind Waker Pictograph), and attempts to at least steal a picture of them.					
Culpex snaps a shot, but the Masked Figure throws a fireball directly at him. It misses the bird’s wings, but hits the Smoke Camera before it can develop a film. The camera is destroyed, and all that’s left is a barely developed photograph.					
The face isn’t there...but their weapon is in full view. Culpex recognizes the axe: it’s an ancient artifact from the Floating Continent. The tomb was heavily guarded, so how did they get it….?					
The Masked Figure sees Culpex escape. They walk away, having finished with their objective in the area and ready to “continue their mission.” Things aren't going to be so lucky for Culpex next time.					
Quest - Sun Stone Temple (Inferno)					
Everyone gets into position.					
First Phase, Liburri vs. Quird. They have to navigate a tunnel in the dark. Both participants are used to seeing in the dark, so it’s pretty neck and neck. However, Liburri’s speed pushes out in the end.					
Second Phase, navigation of the Monster Labyrinth. Liburri passes the Torch to Deyacron, and much later Quird passes the Torch to Trophistus. Deyacron cuts through the monsters, while Trophistus uses a deluge of repels to sneak past them. Trophistus’s method is slower and safer, so he falls behind.					
Third Phase. The main labyrinth. Deyacron passes the torch to Meila, who has to find Havigrel. Trophistus eventually passes the torch to Ozapold, who has to find Winckary.					
Meila struggles a bit in the Labyrinth, but they manage to find Havigrel eventually.					
However, as the two run into each other, Winckary pops in, out of place.					
She has given up on the challenge, everyone here is so boring! She wants to cause a little chaos on her way out, so she is here to cause her share of trouble. Specifically, she wants to steal the Red Torch.					
Meila tries to get past her, but Winckary fires a warning spell towards her. Havigrel sighs. “It’s no use. This is a fight we must win by force.”					
Havigrel and Meila struggle against Winckary, her Bounce Wall renders most projectiles useless. The two struggle to even hit her.					
Things look bad, until...					
...Meila sees that Winckary doesn’t have a shadow.					
She instinctively throws a shiv at Winckary. Despite Havigrel’s warnings that it’ll only ricochet back, and it passes through Winckary and her Bounce Wall, hitting the cavern walls behind her.					
...Oh crap. What they’re fighting is an illusion!					
The Winckary Clone, poofs away with its job done, giggling to itself how much of Meila’s time it was able to waste.					
We cut back to Winckary, the real one.She throws the Blue Torch…					
....and Viveph catches it.					
Phase 4, the Rapuak Race. Havigrel hands the baton to Ehrugarr, who looks like they have been waiting for a while. Their opponent is Viveph, someone less experienced with Rapuaks.					
Ehrugarr...gets a bit lost. The volcanic cliffs of the Sunstone Mountain are disorienting, so he loses Red Team a lot of time.					
Eventually, he reaches Yunyere. Red Team's stretch of the triathlon begins, the climb to Sunstone Colosseum.					
Yunyere casts time magic on himself, and dashes away with the Torch.					
He is a naturally good fit for the challenge. Cliffs and distances no other contestant would be able to climb are conquered in under ten minutes.					
Eventually, Yunyere finally sees it. The beacon! It's a long walk’s way. If he really tries, he’ll get there in no ti-					
*FWOOOOOOOSH*					
Before Yunyere can even register it, a streak of fire pushes past him and darts towards the beacon. He falls onto the pavement.					
Yunyere gets up off the ground, and he sees….					
...Sunstriker, striking a pose behind a beacon burning blue fire.					
Blue Team has won the Quest.					
Flashback. We never saw just how Blue Team formed, so we get the details.					
The first idea was for the Platore Platoon to fight as a collective: Ozapold Quird Havigrel Trophistus Viveph Winckary is six.					
Trophistus looks at this composition and reaches the conclusion that they won’t be able to win against a team where Meila is able to coordinate Sunstriker, Liburri, and Ehrugarr. Sunstriker has it out for Meila, but not enough to self sabotage. Because this challenge is one of speed: they need Sunstriker and her challenge record more than any other contestant to win.					
Trophistus then gets an idea: someone in the Platoon should join the other team and throw so they for sure lose. The winning team controls six of the nine votes this round, so they can collectively vote to save their spy. The Platoon starts skeptical, but eventually are convinced.					
Winckary seems born for this, but Trophistus considers them too obvious. Havigrel is chosen because even if they lose, they wanna make some noise.					
Ranking					
Kennewick didn’t participate in the challenge, so she is not in the rankings. They are safe, but cannot vote.					
Everyone on Blue Team is safe and make up the Top 6.					
Top 3 -					
Third place, Viveph due to how well they piloted their Rapquak.					
Second place, Quird, due to their navigation skills in the first segment.					
In first place....it’s Sunstriker! She is absolutely electric to FINALLY have a quest win all to herself.					
The rest of Blue Team, Trophistus (4th), Ozapold (5th), and Winckary (6th), are safe.					
Safe: -				
This leaves Red Team: Meila, Deyacron, Yunyere, Ehrugarr, Liburri, and Havigrel.					
Yunyere is the highest performing participant in Red Team, he’s in 7th. This still doesn’t make him happy.					
Liburri (8th) and Deyacron (9th) did okay for their team. They’re also safe.					
Bottom 3 -					
Meila is 10th because they fell for Winckary’s trick and wasted a lot of time.					
Ehrugarr cost his team a lot of time, so he’s 11th.					
Havigrel performed awfully, so they’re in 12th.					
Voting					
Meila makes a passionate speech for the save vote, but they think Hivemind will pull through. She tells Deyacron not to use the Depth Plunge since it will be more powerful in the late game.					
Havigrel and Ehrugarr both...don’t really try during their speeches. Neither have historically done great when near the bottom, but even then...					
Trophistus has a secret conversation with Ehrugarr. Something implied in this episode is now confirmed: Trophistus convinced Ehrugarr to throw so he could prove himself in a duel against Meila.					
Not soon after that, Winckary and Havigrel have a secret conversation. The two were working together, and Trophistus bribed them for the act. Winckary begins munching on a bag of Sweetbread.					
Havigrel	“Is that what he gave you? Well, I only got his word. We’ll see if I get my carrot at the end of the stick...in about five minutes.”					
The implication is clear: Trophistus organized the two teams in the Sun Stone Castle race so Meila’s team was guaranteed to lose, with her, Ehrugarr, and a spy from his own team being placed in the bottom three.					
Votes come in.					
Due to Blue Team's six votes to Red Team’s three, Havigrel is saved. All of them have collective immunity to Hivemind, thanks to a Charm Ward. Thus, the duel is Ehrugarr vs Meila.					
Still, Meila’s vote is unnaturally low. Only one vote is thrown their way, and Havigrel has eight votes. Liburri’s vote was most likely sent to Havigrel, Blue Team most likely had a plan, but that leaves Deyacron and Yunyere. Only one of them voted for her. The gears don't have time to turn in her head, though. Her duel against Ehrugarr is up.					
Meila decides to stand up straight, and face her duel with dignity. She asks Ehrugarr to go with all his strength and not hold back just because she’s a woman. Ehrugarr laughs, and says he was never planning to.					
Meila enters a fighting stance. This is her chance to see if she really deserves to be in this game, and she wants proof in either direction if she should continue the path she’s going on.					
Duel - Meila v Ehrugarr					
Meila starts by trying to employ Hivemind’s manipulation, to try and convince Ehrugarr to leave the ring. However, no matter what she thinks, Ehrugarr doesn't budge. He does not have a Charm Ward either.					
The duel shifts to one based on strength. Meila’s main offense are her shivs, but Ehrugarr is able to parry whatever she throws at him. Despite his age, it is still very visible Ehrugarr is a highly trained fighter.					
Without the help of Hivemind, damaging Ehrugarr is an uphill battle for Meila. There’s nothing she can do without Ehrugarr responding with his own offense.					
Finally, the fight decisively ends when Ehrugarr fakes Meila out with an uppercut, creating an opening which he uses to push her out of the ring.					
Post-Match					
Meila is out. She’s definitely a bit bummed, but she’s oddly relieved. Was becoming Zenith’s Successor something she really wanted? Or did she just want to reach the apex of this society’s power? She has been given definitive proof Hivemind’s powers will not write her destiny for her, and has newfound motivation to walk her own path.					
She thanks Ehrugarr for the good fight and the two respectfully shake hands.					
Deyacron is like, weirdly genuine about how much they’re gonna miss Meila. They’re one of few people torn up to see her go. Many people brush it off as Hivemind, but some people think it's real.					
Before she goes, Meila confronts Yunyere. She knows Deyacron voted for her and that Yunyere was the one who flipped. Yunyere tries to act dumb, until they can no longer hold the act. They open up their locket, and pull out a Charm Ward Crystal. Meila is….shocked. Did Hivemind ever work on them?					
Yunyere just gives her that same dull, unimpressed scowl. Her actions in the Undersea Temple proved she was mainly out there for herself, and now it is time for such a selfish person to leave the stage.					
Yunyere:	“You long outlived your usefulness. Farewell.”					
Thus, we are hit with a bombshell confessional from Yunyere - the way he sees it, he is the only person left who deserves to win. With Archie gone and Culpex a traitorous thief, the idea of any of these incompetent, callous, or cowardly people beating him makes him sick to his stomach. This is why Meila had to die: she was simply a means to an end no longer useful to his happy ending.					
Meila seems unfazed by this at this point, she just wanted to know.					
Platore Platoon has an impromptu meeting. With Meila gone, they have the social power in the game now, and are pretty happy over it. Cut to Trophistus. A sense of foreboding is elicited with the fact he’s now in power.					
Cut to Deyacron’s room. Meila is no longer here, and the fate of Team MDAY is grim, Deyacron seems aimless without Meila, but Yunyere promises her that he’ll take over where she left off and “be one hell of a better leader than she was.”					
(.....)					
Back outside the Silver Dragon, Regamirr receives Culpex’s picture. This weapon is one that has been heavily guarded for a long time, so the culprit must have somehow stolen it.					
(....)					
Cut to a mountain peak. We see the man with the three-sided axe again. They take off their mask. They are revealed to be…					
Fazellei, the guard from Nerinorin’s flashback.
