-What the hell do I do with the cipher code in the old Utility.gd?

Nested commands
	If possible, figure out way to disable all ways to jump out of loop with await to babyproof it
	-gosub
	-goto
	-Choice with gosub or goto

Project GUI:
	
	Make button that automatically creates new game folder in game files that comes with all the folders a project needs. Ideally, theyre also color coded.
	Make button that automatically creates .story file in designated Game Folder
