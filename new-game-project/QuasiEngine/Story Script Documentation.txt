Comments:
	; - Put ";" in front of a line to turn it into a comment.

Inlining:
	it's possible to run commands during generic text using inlining.
	use <> in the middle of your code to have a command happen in the middle of text
	ex:
		Lorem ipsum<char Pihqura.Happy pos:75 wait:true> dolor sit amet.
	You can also use <+ > to have conditions that only apply to specific parts of a print.
	ex:
		Lorem ipsum<+ speed:0.5> dolor sit amet.<+ speed:2.5 skip:true>
		The first part of the sentence will run at half speed, the second part will run fullspeed.
